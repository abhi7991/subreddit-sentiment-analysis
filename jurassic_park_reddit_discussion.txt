Post Title: Okay Hollywood, "Deadpool" and "Kingsman: The Secret Service" are both smash hits at the box office. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?

I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of "swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is "they make less money" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. 

EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here.

- One move that made me scratch my head was when they made the *third* Expendable movie PG-13.. I think one of the main draws the first two had was the fact that they were callbacks to the violent, intense R-rated films of yesteryear we all loved watching. Complete with the '80s action heroes we could not understand at all but they could brutally clear out a room of poor, no-name henchmen in a second.

Why they decided the third movie of this franchise had to be PG-13 to reach an audience that didn't even care about it is beyond me. It still did well box-office wise, making $200M on a $90M budget but it was not even close to the $274M the first one did or the $300M+ the second one did. 

It was nice seeing Mel Gibson though. 

*tl;dr* I agree with OP.
- I'm afraid Hollywood is going to look at those numbers and do this, "Think of how much more money we can make if the sequel is PG-13."
- Yo Hollywood, make a fucking Dredd 2 GODAMMIT
- I just want someone to dust off Gore Verbinski's Bioshock film.
- The expendables 3 was the only one in the series as PG-13 the studio thought of grabbing more audience but in the process lost their franchises dedicated fanbase.

Expendable isn't a great series but for hardcore action and bad ass mercenary taunting each other they were fine until they removed all of that just to grab more audience.
- I'm tired of these lame R rated blockbusters. Let's get serious and see that NC-17 Catwoman movie. 
- I dont understand how parents will buy their kids GTA5 and let them stab hookers with a screwdriver, but wont let them see a rated R movie. Makes no damn sense.
- It saddens me that Suicide Squad is PG-13. Like the word death is legit in the title.
- I just want good movies, no matter the rating. I don't mind non-violent blockbuster as long as they are fun. Guardians was PG-13, pretty non-violent and pretty fun for me. I obviously also liked Mad Max a lot (more than Guardians), but it's the same as always: Stop paying for shit, and support the good stuff.

- if these r movies keep hitting big we might end up getting the bioshock movie we all deserve
- "Real people have nipples" OP 2016
- Can we also go back to kids movies like Bad news Bears and the Goonies? 
- I see it like this, make the movie you want to do. If an R rating is part of your vision, so be it, but don't make a movie with an R rating just for the sake of it.
- Why not just disband the MPAA instead?

Watch "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" to understand just how corrupt, arbitrary, and useless the MPAA and their ratings are. Film content ratings should be given by moviegoers, not shady anonymous conservative morality pundits in secret locations
- This has always confused me about apocalypse movies. How can you have an apocalypse that's safe enough for a 13 year old to watch? How can you have a war movie that tame? 
- This is slowly happening. Keep in mind, Warner Bros. Has given DC the permission to do a "hard R" animated version of "Batman: The Killing Joke." Yea, it's animated, and will be a straight to DVD release, but that goes even more to say studios are realizing that R movies do make money.
- Seriously Hollywood, show us more tits and dongs.
- I think the main issue is having a vision for a film that hinges on rated R elements and then being forced to redact or redo scenes to make it rated PG-13. Imagine if blood was completely removed in Kill Bill to reduce the rating. It would affect the tone and style of the film. It goes both ways. A problem with many horror films is the need to add unnecessary snuff to achieve greater affect, but it ruins the film completely. Hostel 2, later Saw movies, and Rob Zombie's remakes comes to mind.
- Can we bring back rated R horror movies? 
- Mad Max could have been PG-13, honestly. Nothing there was really any worse than say, TDK.
- > swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what make a movie good...

Morena Baccarin naked absolutely makes a movie good. 
- R just means the stakes are higher but at the end of the day money matters. even mad max was getting rave reviews and pitch perfect 2 still beat it its first week (domestically at least) 
- It's fairly painful when you watch an action movie, which has obviously been cut to reduce to it PG 13. You see those fast cuts whenever there's an action scene, so that you never see the bullet actually hit or knife stabs.
  
One of the most egregious examples I can think of is not even an action movie, but was [The Internship](http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=56926). There's a lengthy scene that takes place in a strip club and it's full of awkward editing and they literally, I kid you not, blurred the strippers. So you see close ups of obviously nude dancers, but they have blurred their bodies that they have no nipples of genitals, to lower the rating to PG13.
- Why not just leave behind the archaic MPAA's rating system?
- Wasn't the point of this post that Hollywood should stop making pg13 entries for R rated series? I feel like the first 3 comments I read completely ignored the point.  Heck most of the comments are along the lines of "I don't care what the rating is as long as it's a quality movie".  They completely missed ops point. 
- But...you just named three R-rated blockbusters. Clearly we still have them, don't we?
- i hated how terminator isnt rated R anymore, like wtf
- I am going to get a lot of down votes for this most likely but I do not think Fury Road was best picture material. I like the movie but I really think it wasn't THAT great. I really do not like the way they have been picking movies lately for those types of awards.
- IIRC, Godzilla 2014 was supposed to be Rated R early in development because they wanted to emphasize the devastation and loss of human life that the monsters leave in their wake. In early trailers there were clips of bodies all around a train that had been destroyed, and people among bodies trying to help each other out in destroyed buildings. It looked reminiscent of  post 9/11 footage. Was supposed to be some pretty heavy stuff.

[This trailer is nearly impossible to find on YT, its an old teaser from 2012. Its not the greatest quality but it gets the point across.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x200boz_godzilla-2014-comic-con-2012-teaser-trailer_shortfilms) None of these scenes made it into the final cut. I think it could have been a really interesting movie with those scenes. As I've heard, many people thought the human story was weak, maybe the inclusion of scenes like these could have remedied that.   
- I work in this industry. R movies make less money; on average a lot less. Averages being what they are though some do really well. In recognition of this Deadpool had a ~$58 million budget: since returns were presumed to be lower the budget was also lower. Deadpool is from Fox, not Marvel/Disney (Marvel licensed the X-Men to Fox a long time ago - all X-Men movies are from Fox, even though they look like Marvel movies). 

So it's just a matter of economics. If a filmmaker is willing to make a movie for the half the budget a studio may be willing to take a risk on an R rating. But it's less likely to get green lighted if it is a regular $100M+ blockbuster budget: there's just too much money at risk.

That doesn't mean we don't understand these restrictions can erode storytelling (we do), or that this doesn't bother us (it does). There's just nothing we can realistically do about it without risking very cranky shareholders.

- TL;DR - Real people have nipples.
- Dredd
- I whole heartedly agree. Imagine if saving private Ryan had been pg 13. It would have been not only awful, but offensive. I feel in many ways that pg 13 violence is worse because it shows violence as clean and lacking consequences. Really killing people is gruesome and terrible, and by making it pg 13 they remove the weight of violence. While watching dead pool I laughed at the hijinks', but I was often shocked by how violent it was. It sold the insanity of the character more.
- that doesnt mean R Rated movies gonna be hit...            
they need good directors/actors/writers              
great post production but i get ur point             
- I think we have. 

Then again, we've also got three years of Transformers lined up, because they have massive four-quadrant, trans-national appeal, and movies are a business. 
- >REAL people swear.

Nuh uh. Not me. No fucking way. 
- YEAH!

FUCK LITTLE KIDS!

Wait...
- Thumbed up for the headline alone, then read your "rant" and could not agree more. Well said and spot on.
- Just saw deadpool.... Loved it, didn't want it to end.
- CIRCLE

THAT

JERK
- I totally agree with you, but I wish there was a way to fix the reason this is a problem for studios in the first place: The MPAA. I'm aware this will probably never happen due to huge backlash from parents and such, but even if they just kept it up as kind of an FYI but still let people in, it wouldn't handicap them so much. They're only hurting themselves.
- It didn't do well in theaters but Dredd was an amazing movie. I think what held it back was how bad the last movie was. Then word of mouth got out and it was a hit on blu ray. Also John Wick.
- Hey dude, well said. 
Your second paragraph was what carried everything else for me.
Well done.
- Another angle to consider this from is just how flimsy the rating board's system is (in the US). Basically, a pre-selected, anonymous group that *supposedly* represents the average American parent watches movies and then gives them a rating *loosely* based on a set of guidelines. There's a great expose documentary on just how inconsistent the system can be: [This Film Is Not Yet Rated](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/). It focuses mostly on movies being censored by being marked NC-17, but the system seems like it would be just as broken in determining if a film is PG-13 or R.
- I know it's asking a lot, but I want to see the NC17 stigma go away. Got to crawl before you can walk...
- Hunger Games would have been a million times better if they made it as a rated R movie. Watering it down to a PG-13 rating made it boring as fuck!
- > Real people have nipples.

Sorry if this answered any questions, please considering doing the same!
- Saving Private Ryan is a pretty good example of this. So many powerful scenes in that movie. Could you imagine if it had been rated PG-13? That scene where the guy is pleading with the German soldier, then the German slowly plunges the knife into his chest while he's got tears rolling off his nose? Man, to think such a ridiculous, arbitrary rating system could have ruined such a good movie. He'll, to think of all the movies it HAS ruined over the years. Make you sad, doesn't it? 
- My wife and I said the same thing. Quality R rated action comedies are coming back. I think Hollywood has been afraid of violence for about 15 years (9/11 influence possibly?). We even talked about it in our review of Deadpool. 

Shameless plug: https://youtu.be/N_JqJny4aww 
- Thankfully Hollywood is starting to remember that blockbusters are the movies that don't hold back on staying true to themselves.

So sick of financially safe movies. The whole reboot a classic and accommodate it for everyone recipe is just so...blergh.

Edit:
>EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here. 

This is how debate on the Internet works. Narcissism, fallacies, and an unsettled outcome that will be forgotten by all within a few hours.
- Lots of misunderstanding about OP here. So what is the deal?
- [I'll leave this here in support of your point.](https://youtu.be/O-NeJRrgoTY)
- I'll take one Dredd sequel with Karl Urban, please. Thank you.

That dude made me believe he was the LAW!

Or better yet, they could re-interpret Dredd again with Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby. Alex Garland needs scripting duties though.
- I agree that R is ready for a comeback. The reason video games, cable and the internet have taken such a huge bite out of the movie industry is they have mature content. Grand Theft Auto V  Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead would be rated R in theaters. And the internet...well it's the home of porn. But even social media gets an R when you read the comments section. I love superhero movies. But there is so much material out there that would require an R rating. The Authority, Dreadstar and Y: The Last Man. are just a few comics demanding a R rated movie.  Then there are science fiction novels like Old Man's War. Hollywood has to realize that this end train of PG-13 is  the ride we all want. Sure films with the PG-13 rating make a tons of cash. You get the breeders bringing their larva to shows and the money is there. However, that doesn't mean R rated money isn't there either.  It's the type of R fare you give us. Mad Max: Fury Road showed us that audiences are ready for R rated science fiction and intelligent action movies. But you have to advertise. Dreadd could have pull Deadpool box office numbers if people had known it was in theaters. Tons of my friends love that movie, but didn't see it until cable tv. This was due to a weak a advertising campaign. 
Cable Tv used to brag about which Hollywood movies they had, but not anymore. Now they make their own R rated content because Hollywood has left a void. Series like Outlander, Game of Thrones, Black Sails, Daredevil and Jessica Jones are filling that vacuum. Now is the time to move back to mature content that cable can't mimic. Video games hits like Skyrim and Dark Souls shows that R rated fantasy are a genre long ignored.Wake up Hollywood! We are adults clamoring for mature theme content.
- Jurassic Park should have been a hard-R. I'd love to see such a version, closer to the tone of the book, on the big screen.

In the book, there were a dozen+ raptors, not 3, and a lot more people getting eaten on the island.
- Not only that, but I want more traditional effects. Jurassic Park came out in 1994 and it still has better CG than the vast majority of movies today. Point being: audiences can tell when something is CG. Use practical effects!
- I want to see nudity, sex, or violence only when it advances and improves upon the story, character development, etc. 

R for the sake of R isn't the answer. But I was so tired of watching films over the last 30 years that could have been better if they were not so concerned with not going over the PG-13 threshold. 
- Funny thing is in EU all those movies are PG-13
- That's kind of putting the cart before the horse no?
There's no way of knowing a blockbuster from a bomb pre release.
- Real life is rated R. 
- Lets get this to top comment! Like seriously where did all you people learn to interpret articles? It's not a fucking SAT poem 
- Lol thanks for actually reading the post. So many people here are commenting things that I specifically addressed and discussed. 
- Yes! This has been my main gripe with Hollywood in the passed two decades. I feel like the R rated movies I grew up watching (Predator, The Thing, and a million others) helped shape who I am. Deadpool isn't something that should be an oddity. I feel like a few generations have been hand holder into liking watered down trash.
- The whole horror genre has done this and it makes me weep...
- Agreed. The vast majority are missing the point that OP was making. 
- Could you imagine if Alien and Aliens had to get their content changed to make them PG-13 acceptable?  Even the novels/comics I read as a kid were R rated content.  Same goes for Predator and Predator 2 along with the novels/comics for them.

Then there's 90s action classics like Ronin.  I saw it again recently and it is still amazing.

Dark City was more of a cult classic after the fact IIRC, but that was also R rated.

Unrelated: Saw Dark City again recently, was surprised when I realized the MC's actor is currently playing a certain Obergruppenführer in a recent "TV" show.
- That... Doesn't even make sense.

"Let's make a movie about '80s action heroes but hamstring them by removing the majority of what made them popular to maybe appeal to people who weren't even born when they were popular"
- I remember being astonished by Alien v Predator being a 15 (in the UK; I'm not sure what the US direct equivalent is), given that both the Alien and Predator franchises up til that point were definitely 18-rated. 
- How about the PG13 Die Hard 4 and 5? Couldn't even get a yippee kay yay mother fucker in those. 
- Man. I *hate* when a movie cuts away from a kill right before, then cuts back to a dead body right after. I am not seeking gratuitous violence, but when you have someone like Captain America or Vin Diesel in Furious beating the absolute shit out of some villain or henchmen and at the end of a 10 minute fight they only have a small cut on their cheek, it bothers the hell out of me. It takes away from the experience and makes the whole thing seem cheesy. Not that there is anything wrong with cheese, but the problem, I feel, is that these movies (not necessarily the movies I mentioned) try to be edgy and sexy and violent while not showing any edge or nudity or violence past what would be considered a PG-13 rating.
- I read that Chuck Norris pushed for PG-13. 

Edit: So apparently I got my Expendables mixed up, Norris was not in 3 but appeared in 2. I'll live with my mistake if you can.
- Well, there was an extended cut on BluRay afterwards.
- [deleted]
- Well for deadpool at least, it would be much much less.
- Now that's a terrifying thought
- "And with a shirtless Zac Efron." 
- Karl Urban would be on board from what I've seen. Throw him back in the helmet, keep it gritty and let me see the LawMaster a little more 
- [It's already been too long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZrsJsvL30g)
- It made $41.5 million on a $45 million budget (and probably more for promotion), and Alex Garland has straight up referred to it as a "failed movie". It's not happening, and if it does it'd be a reboot.
- Hell yeah, Dredd was excellent I've probably watched it six times.
- [Dredd: The Musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZrsJsvL30g)
- I want netflix to purchase it, and turn it into an awesome series.

I think it has a shit ton of potential as the next gritty and bloody series.
- my biggest regret is not seeing Dredd 3D in theaters...
- [deleted]
- Man I just want someone to dust off Gore Verbinski
- There's not going to be a *Bioshock* movie, nor should there be. Both are about the nature of games, they make no sense as a movie. Pretty sure Ken Levine already put his foot down on that.
- Forget Bioshock, I want him to do another animated feature, Rango was fantastic!
- 1 and 2 had the raw action hero movies feel as those of the 80s

Rambo
Lethal Weapons
Bloodsport

People loved Expendables because it felt like a classic action movie. Plot did not matter, it was Action Heroes killing bad people and stuff exploded. 

Then they censored the shit out of Expendables 3 and it was the weakest one. 
- Full penetration shown.
- Then we'd get a good basketball scene.
- When was the last NC-17 movie shown in theaters?
- Parents either never see there kid play the game or they go on the assumption its all cartoony (or fake looking) while movies have a more realistic look. 
- There are billions of parents in the world. There's going to be conflicting behaviors between them.
- It's a movie about villains doing bad things and it's not R? What the fuck? 
- IMO I think the PG-13 can still work for this movie. Would I have preferred R? Of course, but making this movie R would be a ballsy movie that I don't think WB can take at this point in the DCCU.
- You don't understand, Suicide Squad is tailor made for 13th birthdays
- Suicide Squad is way too edgy and campy to be anything but PG-13, though. The rating makes perfect sense for the tone of the movie.
- It's been done well plenty of times in animation and on Arrow.
- I'm still conflicted as to whether Guardians of the Galaxy would have been better if it was R. I'm leaning towards "No".

Also to clarify this is a general statement not directed towards you gumpmeister.
- I've actually wondered about this, are rating restrictions really that much enforced in the U.S.? I mean, say the theater lets a 14 year old in, could they get in trouble?

I live in Portugal and when I was a kid/teenager I was always able to watch every movie I wanted at the theater. Always figured the rating system was supposed to work more like a guideline for parents than anything (i.e. "better not watch this one with the whole family").

Deadpool here is M14 (14 year olds and up) and yesterday there was a grandpa with his grandson at the IMAX showing I attended. The room was almost fully packed and the kid couldn't be older than 9. Keep in mind, we only have 2 IMAX theaters in the whole country, belonging to the biggest national chain, so I guess they don't really enforce it here. Don't really know how it is in the rest of Europe, though I do remember when I was 11, I tried to buy a GTA game in London for the PSP and the guy wouldn't sell it to me, I was in utter shock. I had to ask my friend's mom to buy it.
- Guardians was always going to be a PG-13 film, but it managed to be a family, action film that snuck in a cum joke. That's a skill.
- For my tastes I would prefer comedies and action movies be rated R.  If there is a group of people over the age of 13 doing anything there will be swearing.
- The bloodless and goreless wars of the Avengers/Captain America/Hunger Games destroy my immersion. In real life, I would see what happens. I know it's a movie, because they always fall wound-side down.
- Moment of silence for the excellent lesbian romantic comedy that movie would have been if anyone in the vicinity of its production had any amount of courage.
- Or at the mountains of madness
- I want it sooo badly.
- He's not wrong 
- "Jews, spics, niggers, and now a girl?!"
-Tanner Boyle
- I think the problem is that the reverse logic was being used. "Make the movie you want to make, but make it PG 13." The subject matter may have called for certain elements but the money behind the production knew that a 5/10 PG 13 movie will make more than an 8/10 R rated one. 
- I pretty much addressed that when I mentioned James Bond and Jurassic Park. I'm fine with those not being R because they were never supposed to be. The real problem is when things that were R, or are supposed to be R, get knocked down. It neuters a lot of artistic visions. 
- But the problem is film makers are having a hard time convincing  studios to let them make their R-Rated visions. 
- I think the problem is most people don't actually set out to make an R rated movie.  The don't take something and add to it until its rated R, its usually rated R because thats what they wanted to make, then whittled down to shit for a 13 rating.
- Reminds me of when M. Knight Shamalyan marketed *The Happening* as his "first rated-R movie" as if that would entice people to watch it. *Cringe.*
- Nipples and weed? Literally worse than Hitler.
- But wont someone think of the children!!!
- Yup. Quebec has a pretty good system imo. I'm always confused by these posts because all of these movies are pg-13 here. And honestly, these are fine for teenagers to watch. If you read the fine print (its pretty large actually) it explains why the movie got its rating. 

If a movie here is pg-16 or rated R, I generally won't see it. I know that the rating is meaningful. That movie will always have a significant amount of graphic violence/torture, and I'm just not interested in that.
- The opening of [Sex Drive: Unrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c9WD8ETd8g) that gave you exactly that.

More tits. . . and more cock.
- I am so excited for The Witch for this reason.
- It Follows
- The content was so dark it should be made R.  Milking pregnant ladies like cows, running over a pregnant girl, taking the fetus from her corpse, etc.  The entire franchise is in a very R rated world.
- I kinda disagree a little. It wasn't too graphic for kids, but the implied rape and sex slavery could get pretty dark for kids.


I remember being far more affected than things like that as a kid, than graphic violence. Because it's so emotionally disturbing.


But still considering that it's not a definite "R" rating from me. Since I personally would use a "better safe than sorry" approach to this I don't blame Hollywood for doing the same. 
- I think that's a good sign. The fact that it was R rated despite it being fairly tame shows that George Miller simply made the movie he wanted. He wasn't concerned with the MPAA rating. This is how movies SHOULD be. Movie studios are way too concerned with meeting a specific rating. Even Deadpool was aiming for an R. Just make a good movie. Trying to be without the bounds of the MPAA is not a good thing, artistically. 
- It was rated 14A in Canada and I believe that's an accurate rating for it. Why the fucking MPAA hasn't created a rating yet for movies that fall in between a PG-13 & R is beyond me. 
- (mad max spoilers)

They'd need to cut the mother's milk, pan away as Immortan Joe gets his face ripped off, only imply the postmortem cesection, and put a bit more clothing on the rescued girls. I think those are the only really R-rated bits, and none are particularly important to the movie as a whole. There may be a few other kills that pushed the limits of PG13, but it could easily be cleaned up with only minor alterations.
- This. No swear words (except one muttered fuck, IIRC), gore at a minimum, practically no nudity. Giving it a PG-13 would arise the anger with the fans but let's be honest, not much would have changed. 
- The sex montage was both hot and hilarious.
- That's another deal all together. That's a burgeoning popcorn fluff franchise with broad commercial appeal vs. a 30 year old cult film franchise opening against each other.
- I think we should leave the "This movie contains: blood, violence, nudity, etc" for people who want to avoid those things. I *love* all those things personally but to each his own. 

This review and rating system and constant oversight by the MPAA needs to go. Nobody should set out to make a pg-13 movie and have to have the MPAA grade them and say "nope: remove this this and this and we can give you a PG-13". Just state what sort of content is in the movie and let people decide from there. 
- Every time an R rated movie is mentioned, I look up the rating and its typically 14A here in Canada.
- I've been working on big budget movies for years. The MPAA system is ridiculous, and is all powerful. For instance on Breaking Dawn we could do anything we wanted to the vampires, rip their heads off, limbs, have them being mauled by wolves, fall to their deaths, but show any blood and all of a sudden it's too violent and gets an R rating.
- Because it's useful to have. It bugs me to see games on Steam with no rating. I might want to play it with my kid brother, but I have no idea what sort of content is in it. Having a general rating system is very useful in that regard. 
- They're all recent movies, that's the point. They're bucking the established trend. Hopefully Hollywood will take note of this.
- Well Deadpool barely got made 

Mad Max Fury Road being R was a surprise to everyone. I think most assumed it would become PG-13 like a lot of other series. 
- R rated hits don't even need to be good, they just need to get a ton of commercials and stuff to make them look good. 

The academy awards are filled with R rated films. They are well acted, written, and directed. But they won't tend to make a lot of money because they aren't commercialized. Deadpool got a lot of Internet hype and advertising. So did Kingsman. They aren't necessarily the very best films of the year, but they get people to come to the theater. 
- Dude, he already said that. 
- >they need good directors/actors/writers

This is like saying that for a restaurant to be good it needs good chefs, ingredients, and recipes. 
- you can always expect the circlejerk calling circlejerk in /r/movies posts talking about movies..

Its like when people use the subreddit for its purpose, other people complain that its a circlejerk. We are here to discuss movies... not just post trailers to the next MCU movie.
- Memeing aside though, is there anything in this post you actually disagree with? 
- they should make Dredd a netflix show ... same actors from the movie. Would be sooooo cool.
- Yeah, there is. 

A blockbuster isn't necessarily a successful movie. It's a movie with a lavish budget and production, that's **expected** to have success and wide appeal. It describes a certain type of movie, not a movie's international gross. 
- Eh, I prefer the unrated version.
- Given how hard people are fucking up with their comprehension of op's post, it probably should be put on the SATs.
- It's the Internet.  People misinterpret and rage; it's like 50% of the traffic on this site.
- Lol it's Reddit fairly safe to assume they only read the title.
- Haha reading anything beyond the title seems to be a lost art eh. Good post I wholeheartedly concur.
- I think war horse is the perfect example. You can't make a war in which millions of people died in brutal ways PG-13. It just doesn't work that way.
- The film industry has changed a lot in those last two decades, with the lifecycle of investment recoupment taking a battering. You used to be able to rely on the sell-through window to make back a big chunk, and you used to be able to finance through international pre-sales.

Today you're competing with downloading, with a stronger than ever video game sector, and blockbuster TV.

The change is a reflection of an economic reality. Yes it would be lovely if people would gamble their money on R-rated films, but the audience doesn't support that in the same numbers that they used to, a few isolated successes notwithstanding.
- Hollywood producers do not make decision based on common sense or logic.
- Deadpool was an R in the states and 15 in the UK. So I'm guessing it's fairly similar to that, with their NC-17 being the UK 18.
- Which is odd, considering it had plenty of violence/gore.
- I'm assuming pg-13 is the equivalent.

We have, G(baby children, super young children), PG(kids 5-10 ish), PG-13(obviously 13), R(17 with parent or guardian, otherwise 18), NC-17(can't get in unless you're 18) afaik.

- No rating could have saved Die Hard 5.
- That's one of the many reasons I love Netflix's Daredevil - the dude loses a ton of blood, breaks his bones and spends days injured in bed after a decent fight.

Compared to Arrow (for example) where if someone comes really close to death, they might have a *black eye* to go with their scratched cheek and cut lip. That's how you know it's serious, they have one additional facial injury that requires no real treatment whatsoever. Or they'll lie there in a pristine coma for an episode whenever some magical shit goes down. Maybe coughing occasionally.
- I think that if any movie action is bad for kids then it is the kind of cartoon violence that shows no consequences for that violence.


Getting punched in the face by fucking captain America means that you swallow a mouthful of teeth and need reconstructive surgery.
- He really should go back to hitting things hard, and not talking very much. 
- *Thanks Chuck Norris*
- Nah, he just didn't want any swearing (but was OK with the violence which Expendables 2 had LOTS of in buckets) in exchange for appearing in the second one.  He's a hard-right wing conservative Christian and it sucks when he lets his beliefs get in the way of entertainment (no swearing meant it was just "Yippie-Kai Yay" which was blasphemy).

He wasn't in the third one for I dunno, reasons.
- Stop spreading misinformation.

He wanted Expendables 2 to be PG-13. It wasn't. 

He wasn't even in The Expendables 3. So that has no bearing on why the third one was PG-13. 
- He was in part 2 not part 3. He didn't agree with the extreme violence and wanted it toned down to which stallone said no. Don't know why you are getting so many upvotes.
- I don't know if you're intentionally referencing this (probably you are), but that's exactly what Bruce Willis said to Fox execs when they tried to interfere with the script of Die Hard 4. [As told by Kevin Smith.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui4Z1h7PG5s)

It's too bad that Bruce Willis doesn't seem to exist anymore.

- Guess who will be Waiting...
- I like this plan, where do I sign?
- I want to hear him say maw maw in that voice again.

- Can we get Lena Headey in there somehow too? God she was amazing in Dredd.
- We're sorry, there was a horrible proofreading accident and you'll be getting Keith Urban in Dredd 2.
- Its time to MAKE DREDD 2!
- There are times when I would like to upvote more than once. I salute you sir. Root post is getting one too.
- Megacity is overflowing with scum, it's almost as bad as New Jersey.
- That is only because no one heard of the movie. If they had a half decent marketing firm behind it, it would have been a hit. Look at all the reviews, people liked it. 
- There was talk after it came out on Blu-Ray and DVD that a sequel could still happen because of how well it was selling. 

On top of the 41 million it made in theaters, it made $18.7 million on dvd and blu-ray.

- I don't think I'd be very excited about it unless Garland is involved in some capacity. Sounds kinda like he's moved on.
- Thing is you cant do rapture on a low budget. That shit needs Avatar money.
- It is possible that they could twist it from being "commentary on linear gameplay" into "commentary on passive consumption," but it'd be quite a feat indeed.
- They shouldn't follow the plot of the game. Expand the universe, don't just retell it.

HOW CAN PG13 JUSTIFY THAT
- If you read the source material from 2009 they were more like a ww2 guerilla warfare story set in space so I felt like it was pretty watered down, imho could have been a great R but not with their director. 
- Pros: better fights, alien boobs.

Cons: talking raccoons and ents don't fit very well.
- They card for R-rating where I live, but if you're with a parent they can let you in at most ages. 
- In the UK deadpool is a 15 and you wouldn't be able to see it in the cinema if you look under 15 (there isn't really any form of ID for those under 17 though). Film's are not as strictly enforced as say the sale of alcohol of cigarettes. Games sales are slightly stricter for checking ID, and the reason they wouldn't sell the GTA game to you is because the shop keeper would have got a hefty fine.

- MPAA ratings are not a law in the United States, they are a voluntary system the industry enforces to keep legislators out of the realm of theaters and to inform audiences. The vast majority of theaters in the US enforce these policies. It's very similar to the ratings system on video games. It's not a crime to sell an R rated ticket to a minor, but the concern is that if it ever be became prevalent, it one day might be, and that's what everyone wants to avoid.

- The rating system here isn't legally binding, but most theaters are pretty strict about it. 
- >Deadpool here is M14 (14 year olds and up)

13+ in Quebec.  It's *hard* to get an R rating in Quebec.  
- If you are under the "appropriate" age for a film you can still come in if you are accompanied by an adult or above-age guardian.  The only exception are films rated NC-17, which are "nobody under 17 period".

Keep in mind there isn't any specific uniform law which requires theaters to do this (other than local laws in some very uptight areas), but the theaters do have to answer to the studios and MPAA.  Enough violations and they could get refused distribution of new releases. Can't run a good movie theater if you can't play anything but 1+ year old movies.  As far as the people seeing the movie are concerned though, it's not illegal.  The theater might kick you out and ban you from returning, but that's about it.
- The theater I work at enforces the R rating policy like its alcohol. Id's or you have to be accompanied by a parent. No exceptions. If we catch you sneaking into an R rated movie, you are thrown out immediately. So many times a parent will be like "I am giving him permission to go" and they get upset when we tell them they have to be with them
- That Pollock joke really came out of nowhere in the film.
- It was well done. Even if you're some 12 year old who knows what cum is, it's not likely that you're gonna know who Jackson Pollock was and what his art looked like, let alone knowing that bodily fluids glow under a black light. 

Also, it was a PG-13 movie, so there can be a lot of those jokes, just not explicit terms or swearing. 
- Ha I noticed that too. It made me laugh and then I realized it's technically a family type film and was amazed they kept that line in there.
- I missed the joke actually, when did it happen? 


- i guess its a trade-off. Yes, its a cum joke, but to understand it you also need some knowledge of art history.
- I want this so so so so bad. There needs to be more HP Lovecraft movies. 
- So if I don't have nipples I'm not a real people?
- Nowadays people would probably set the cinema on fire without understanding that it's educational.
- Offensive? Yes. But truly aware of how shitty kids actually are.

Also keep in mind that one of the ringers was a girl and an openly Muslim kid called one out for Allah before bunting, all of this without being pandering. 
- Right, the opposite of what he mentioned is far more applicable nowadays.
- Robocop, Total Recall, Die Hard, Terminator, etc. Yeah, man, I'm with you. I'm getting so annoyed with trying to make everything accessible to "all audiences."  If a movie's premise is violent or sexual in nature, Hollywood shouldn't be trying to water it down for the sake of making it more commercially viable. Because, in truth, you're not making it more commercially viable, you're just making a movie with a more widespread lukewarm response.

Most of this over-saturation of PG-13 movie's has a lot to do with the influx of comic book movies. This seems to have created the biggest hurdle for Hollywood in terms of coming to terms with the R-rated nature of some of these stories because the execs know that comic book stories have widespread appeal with the casual audience. 
- Jurassic Park itself was a very violent and adult themed story. The book was definitely in the horror genre, Spielberg made it for kids. There is a scene in the novel where Nedry holds his warm intestines in his hands after being sliced open by a dinosaur.
- I always think of The Dark Knight. It was PG-13 but definitely felt like an R movie and I wonder if they could've made it even more intense if they pushed it further and embraced an R rating.
- Like the 4th Die Hard movie going down to PG-13?
- let's hope they use movies like Deadpool and Kick-Ass in their arguement. and now is the perfect time with Deadpool killing it, just look at Todd Mcfarlane pushing his spawn movie all of a sudden
- And then the random, added in tits and dongs throughout the movie that were just green screened in. Fantastic movie. 
- Underrated film
- And TDK is a film about terrorism, has scenes of torture, terror and implications of solid murder and personal mutilation. 

But because it didn't have a ickle baddy word like fuck and it didn't show blood, we get a 12 rated movie. 
- To be fair, had mothers milk and the dead baby never made it into the cut and no one knew they existed，the film would have been more or less a pg13 movie and still been just as good. 
- Yeah, we have the 15 rating in the UK.

Deadpool and Kingsman: The Secret Service was a 15 here.

Whereas something like The Wolf of Wall Street is an 18.

There's U (Universal, everyone) PG, 12A (No one under 12 admitted, unless with an adult.) 15 and 18 here.

You can also get married and have kids here at 16 here, I think it's a bit stupid that you can get married at 16, have a baby when you're 17, and not be allowed to see a movie rated "18".
- Canada's 14A is essentially PG-13. Canada has:  
G - General Audience  
PG - Parental Guidance  
14A - Under 14 must be accompanied by an adult  
18A - Under 18 must be accompanied by an adult  
R - Must be 18 or older

The US has the same first 2. Then has:  
PG-13  - Parents strongly cautioned, may be inappropriate for pre-teens  
R - Under 17 must be accompanied by an adult  
NC-17 - Must be 17 or older


14A is more strict than PG-13, and then 18A is essentially equivalent to R, while Canada's R is equal to NC-17 (with one year difference). NC-17 ratings in the US very rarely happen, the last well known release I can think of was Showgirls in 1995. It is occasionally threatened, such as Blue Valentine or South Park.
- I feel like a lot of movies that were rated R and PG-13 could have been better or done better if a PG-15 existed. Movies like TDK, The Matrix, Mad Max, and Superhero movies in general 
- Those things are important to the film.  They describe the brutality of the world.  A film is more than dialogue and stunts.  It has to build a world and convey how it feels to live in that world.
- > pan away as Immortan Joe gets his face ripped off,... and put a bit more clothing on the rescued girls.

I'm not even sure about these two. I think they could have gotten away with it with these both in.
- I rather feel it would have changed the feel if the movie alot
- In the 80s it would have been pg-13
- And remove the chrome face spray. Can you imagine high school kids imitating that?
- Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the spray can chrome also labeled as drug use? So they'd need to scratch that as well
- ...and this is how PG-13 movies get made. Nobody goes to an R rated movie for a splatterfest but if there's nothing good there's no point. It's like watching just the first 20 minutes of a porn movie. Will he fix the cable or not??

- Honestly, even as it is it's not that much worse that the dark knight. Maybe the whole milk part, but that's about it.


I suspect that the dark knight called in a lot of favors and twisted a lot of arms to get its rating while mad max was just going to be rated r from the start regardless of content.
- >pan away as Immortan Joe gets his face ripped off

There's nothing to pan away from. That scene literally lasted a fraction of a second. 
- "C-section" - Caesarean section :)
- 100% agree. I know parents appreciate the rating systems to help their children watch appropriate films, but I think dumping the letters and just using those descriptions could work just as well.
- *The King's Speech* was rated PG here in Canada and R in the States because the main character says "fuck" a couple times in order to overcome a stutter. 

.. The MPAA really sucks sometimes. ^^^most ^^^times
- Don't you think that the mpaa system is too much focused on swearing and nudity while completely ignoring violence? Avatar wasn't rated r while it was about brutally murdering native people in a genocide. 

A system that gives scores per category (nudity, violance, swearing, drug usage etc) would be best and fit better with different parenting styles. 
- I feel like they should still list the stuff like violence, drugs, etc, but not put the rating.  Then it makes it so the parents really have to think if they want their kids doing that instead of just banning rating M games for example.
- The thing is that those ratings aren't accurate to context. I could probably see most kids playing Binding of Isaac just fine but the CoD games might be too extreme, yet BoI would probably be rated worse due to much darker implications and situations.
- But they got made. 

And before these, there were movies like Prometheus, Cabin in the Woods, The Expendables,  American Sniper,  The Conjuring,  Lucy, 300, Sin City, the dozens of R rated comedies we see every year...

Where do you think R rated Blockbusters went?
- Well... I think I kind of disagree with the whole premise. The success of Kingsman, Deadpool, and Mad Max to me seems to indicate that Hollywood IS making R-rated blockbusters.
- Well, Deadpool is not a blockbuster, then. It's budget was only $58 million. 
- Kind of interesting that particular movie was directed by the man who also made 'Saving Private Ryan' which was rated R and had some of the most intense war imagery ever depicted on film and was also fantastic and won 5 Academy Awards.
- They're after dollars not sense.
- R is 17 unless accompanied by a guardian, there is no lower age limit. Interestingly, NC-17 was originally _no children under 17_, but it does appear to have changed to _no children 17 and under_ at some point.
- It's not really the same, ratings in the UK are a legal issue, the highest rating that still allows bringing a child in with you is 12A, 12, 15 and 18 are age ratings that ignore whether you're with an adult or not, which is partly why Deadpool is 15 rated in the UK and R in the US.
- To be honest, when they did the theatrical re-release of Alien it was a PG-13 in Canada. Alien and the first predator would've been pretty marginal in either direction if they were rated today, I suspect.
- Yeah it seems like part of the problem is that the US lacks a rating band between PG-13 and R. In Oz, Deadpool is MA15+. We have three "guideline" ratings, which have no legal basis - G, PG, and M. Then there are the legal ones, MA 15+, R 18+, X 18+. The majority of films that would be rated as R in the US are only MA15+ here. 

I'm really surprised that there hasn't been a bigger push in the US for another intermediate rating. It seems bizarre that studios would be happy with no middle-ground rating, given that they want bigger audiences.
- Generally speaking, I think the sequels are more suitable for kids.  Alien is fucking nightmare fuel.
- Or in the case of one of the pirates in 2, go head first into the dark ocean
- He should talk less, smile more.

- It's pretty sad that Kevin and Bruce had a falling out during cop out. In this clip you can see how he used to idolize the man.
- >It's too bad that Bruce Willis doesn't seem to exist anymore.

Plot twist; he never did.
- He actually just premiered on Broadway, but I'm not sure of the details.
- Kevin Smith has such tiny legs compared to the rest of him
- Why does Kevin Smith wear so many layers when he knows that he sweats that much? 
- It's funny how congenial Kevin is here about Bruce Willis, as Cop Out was yet to happen. 
- Well, she does have range.
- Nah, she's got to be big burly Cable
- ...I'd watch Keira Knightley as Deadpool.
- He Prob Said Kiera Knightley because shes already done a Domino movie!
- That sounds great and all but when will we get our Pandapool movie. There's an entire pandaverse that needs to be explored before we have a new human super hero.

- As amazing as she was, I'd rather they not bring her back. I think Peach Trees was pretty well wrapped up. As long as they get both Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby, I'll be happy with any Dredd sequel.
- She exploded at the end... She was a great one-shot villain, but that's all she was.
- Uh...I don't think that's possible.
- They advertised it as Dredd 3D which I think caused quite a few people to write it off as another "Stupid 3D money grab". 
- Not to mention is was being marketed as Dredd 3D. I for one didn't watch it until blu-ray and was blown away but how awesome it was. Wish I had seen it in theaters.

- It's overrated on reddit. It had decent marketing and couldn't do much with it. It doesn't have broad appeal. It's only a 7.0 on IMDb but Redditors act like it has an 8.0+ rating
- First I heard of the movie was Netflix recommending it to me. 
- Correction,  people LOVED it.
- Yeah, but it didn't.  Garland has said there won't be a sequel and if there is another Dredd movie it won't be connected to his film at all.  We are all just being realistic here.
- Frankly i might be happy that, if the movie cant be made right, it isnt made at all. Worst case there is nothing to risk souring our memory of the title, best case it leaves it open to still be done right later on.

I dont want another Last Airbender
- The thing is that if you invest avatar - level money, you get a safe, stale movie like avatar.
- Probably removing most of the famous guys for half the movie in favor of pushing a new generation of action stars down our throat, which isn't necessarily a problem except for the fact that The Expendables franchise was built on the action stars of yesteryear.  Remove that marketing gimmick and you just have a contemporary action movie that doesn't stand out from the pack.
- I don't think the PG-13 rating was the only thing wrong with it, but it certainly didn't help.

But you're right the whole movie just felt somehow off, but I can't really say what was off about it.
- In the fifth sense
- With smell-o-vision!
- Oh wow, a lot more recent than I thought. Thanks!

Speaking of, why didn't they make Fifty Shades of Gray an NC-17 film? I heard the whole thing was basically softcore porn anyway.
- And that movie being the shitshow that it was pretty much helped kill the NC-17 rating in general releases.
- [removed]
- Why not with their director? He's worked on almost exclusively R-rated or adult themed films in the past. Surely he would have been the perfect person to make it as an R?

- Are you saying that James Gunn is incapable of doing R-Rated material or what? Why couldn't it have been Rated R with James Gunn directing? Because it really has nothing to do with him and everything to so with the MCU initiative set forth by Kevin Feige and Disney. James Gunn is a sick, degenerate who got his start working on TROMA films and directed the fantastic sci-fi/horror Slither.
- No, DNA's Guardians were pretty solidly a superhero team in space. Giffen's Star-Lord was more that, but it had a bunch of different characters in it, and was from 2007.

- You had me at alien boobs. Three boobed aliens is one of my favorite movie moments of all time. 
- They card at the front gate, but then you can just walk to the rated r theatre once you're inside
- I had to do some commando-level shit to get to see Deadpool yesterday (15yr , going 16 in a week) though.
- Probably doesn't even have to be a parent. Just an adult. I saw Deadpool yesterday. Half the row in front of me had to be under 12 years old. It made the movie so much better to know that 12 year olds were being potentially traumatized.
- > Film's are not as strictly enforced as say the sale of alcohol of cigarettes. Games sales are slightly stricter for checking ID, and the reason they wouldn't sell the GTA game to you is because the shop keeper would have got a hefty fine.

My experience was that shops in general are stricter.
- I wish it was the law in the US. Some asshat brought his two year old in to see Deadpool today. 
- "Death and Boobies". Haha there's a classic R rated b-movie title right there.
- But dirty joke buddy cop movies? Nope, that'll taint your moral senses!
- What is an example of R in Quebec?
- They get upset because that's retarded
- I feel like this is also so the younger people don't bug people trying to enjoy the movie. Any time a group of teens enters a theater taking up a whole row.  It's a flip of the coin if they are going to ruin my experience or not. One girl was taking selfies during starwars, and the rest of their pack would leave in groups of two at random times. was about 9 of them total and i'm not sure a single one of them sat for the entire showing. 
- Gamora tells star prince his ship is filthy. As she leaves he turns to rocket and says "oh man, she has no idea. If i had a black light the place would light up like a pollock painting" or something like that
- and by more, you mean any. Still pissed that they wanted a pg-13 movie. Lovecraft would NOT work in pg-13
- Yes
- I agree with both of you, remember though the Hollywood machine is there to make money, nothing else.
- PG-13 being overdone isn't due just to the recent (is '08 recent)  success of comic book movies. It goes back much further than that. It really started getting bad around the turn of the century. Yes there were standout R films,  but many films felt neutered or had directors clamoring that they had to obey the studios to get the film out the door. That PG-13 badge has created a lot of lackluster flicks for a while now. A change is needed. 
- Suckerpunch. After watchmen I couldn't believe it was a 12.
- I don't see what the comic book movies have to do with it. Most of the comic book movies we've gotten don't need to be more than a PG-13 and the stuff that did like *Kick-Ass, Deadpool* and  *Kingsman* were R-rated.
- It also has to do with the fact that adults might not want to go but the theaters make it a pain to send our kids without us. I took a bunch of teenagers to Ted when it opened. They loved it and wanted to go again. It was a good movie but I didn't want to go again and it was a big pain to send them without me. 

It was idiotic that 5 kids drove themselves to a theater but couldn't go in without an adult
- Totally agree with this. That part stuck with me for years after reading it. And the bit where Wu gets ripped in half by velociraptors. I'd have loved to have seen a more grown up take on that book. (Not that I didn't love the one we got)
- Also, there's a horribly mangled velociraptor attack survivor who spurts blood everywhere in a doctor's office before dying in terrible agony under blood curdling screams in the first couple of pages. 
- A bunch of greasy cables 
- I read it for school in like, 8th or 9th grade. 
- Yea, but I also think of it as a good example of a PG-13 movie that didn't need to be R to get its point across and be a compelling thriller/action movie. There were some scenes that could have been brutal as fuck if it was R but at the same time I don't feel like anything was truly lost without it 
- But the sad thing is that the 5th one was worse, and I'm not too crazy about Justin Long in a Die Hard, but I still felt the 4th was more enjoyable than the 5th.

A Good Day to Die Hard tried too hard to be an R movie, and really missed the mark.
- That's more of a failure of the ratings board criteria more than anything. 
- yeap, which is why the whole mpaa should just be disbanded. they're a censorship organization. their ratings are entirely useless and so incredibly arbitrary.
- Bad life choices don't make ratings redundant. Now if you'd said you can join the British army at 16, with consent, but are being banned from seeing a film that is based on what you're about to be paid to do then you'd have a better point. 
- Its like here in the US you can sign up go to war at 18 but can't have a beer tell 21 dumb. Sorry off topic. 
- I actually did a paper a couple years ago on how terrible the MPAA rating system is and how ridiculous America's double standards are when it comes to what's acceptable and what isn't. They can have tons of violence in a PG-13 movie but show one nipple... Nope, can't let those poor impressionable children see that. Slap an R rating on it.
- You actually need to be 18 to see NC-17 movies
- I'll add to that that it's different for each Province. Deadpool was 14A in all Provinces except Ontario and Manitoba, with the exception of Quebec where it was 13+ (PG-13)
- I remember seeing PG-13 as a rating in Canadian theaters at one point, but I believe it was removed for being redundant.

Most PG-13 movies here are rated PG, 14A is more serious like you said and most R-rated US movies are 18A - Deadpool is 18A.  R is rarely used and only for movies that feature explicit sex or super-extreme violence. 

If anything, our ratings systems have been criticized for being too lax.
- If Harvey Dent can walk around half the movie with half of his face burned off, it doesn't seem like Immortan Joe's death should be beyond the pale.
- Yeah, it would've felt more PG-13, probably.
- "He fixes the cable?"
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.
- And now there are websites that help with that for parents (even if some of them are run by religious wackos). 
- That's fucking retarded.
- Canada will say fuck on primetime TV, if it's warranted - of which the first instance was the Degrassi High TV movie.
- I think the degree matters, though.

Star Wars and Pulp Fiction both have 'violence'.
- How in the world is Cabin in the Woods a blockbuster? Aside from it being fairly low-budget, it's a horror film. Those are almost always rated R anyway.
- the problem is that there weren't as many R rated movies in 2015 as there were in the 80s and 90s
- The whole MPAA needs to be reformed they have no consistency why dont they have a 15+ rating like australia does. The jump from 13 to 18 is ridiculous.
- "With much sense, come many mo' dollars"
- Alien maybe since a lot of that was atmospherical. Predator hell no. Those skinned bodies alone.
- Predator on the other hand was gory as fuck and full of swearing. 
- Or in the case of one of the Hydra goons in the first, face first into a god damn propeller 
- He should not let us know what he's against or what he's for.
- I'LL upvote you, Hamilton buddy
- http://i.imgur.com/vkMfQug.gifv
- He's been dead the whole time!
- He played the lead role in Stephen King's "Misery." I saw it. Awesome play, but Bruce's performance was bordering on lackluster.
- He plays Paul Sheldon in Misery alongside Laurie Metcalf. I think he did a very nice job in the role.
- Those are big shorts under a large coat, but they are most certainly the legs of a fat man.
- he's lost weight. So he's more proportional now


- *Insert random quote to signify that I, too, saw Deadpool*
- And flexibility? 

Wait wrong reference
- I'd do Keira Knightley as Deadpool.

- Dat half second body double mindfuck scene with olivia thirlby
- That was me. Skipped it in theaters and only watched it much later on Netflix because a friend kept telling me it was great. 
- Ironically I've heard that the 3D in Dredd was actually pretty decent, which is frustrating considering most of the 3D films coming out at the time were shit.
- I think the 3D moniker really hampered the film's success. General audiences were sick of 3D by the time Dredd rolled around. 
- This is exactly the case. "3D" in the title instantly signifies garbage movie.

That plus the Stallone 80's legacy meant I had absolutely zero desire to see this movie. Ended up catching it on video when my husband brought it home and I was too lazy to take my ass upstairs off the couch. I LOVED IT. Karl Urban kicks ass, the story is solid, the cinematography is riveting.

Such a missed opportunity. This movie could have been a smash with the right marketing.

TL:DR 40 year old housewife fucking loved Dredd. It's so much better than anyone would think from the shit marketing.
- Can confirm, didn't watch it at first because the "3D" made me assume it was going to be really shitty. 
- [deleted]
- Putting "3D" in the name is just resoundingly stupid. If you give the impression that the fact that it's in 3D is just as important or impressive as what the movie is about, you can't help but also give the impression that the subject and substance of the movie are no more important than the fact that it's in 3D.

"Dredd: just as awesome as 3D movie technology" is not complimentary at all. It's like they tried to blow their own horn and inhaled.
- exactly.  I dismissed (my loss) this movie based on the name assuming it was a stupid fucking hollywood bullshit 3d movie.

turns out it was awesome and whoever decided to name the movie should have been given a strong talking to.
- Reddit loves it.  A huge chunk of those who saw it just thought it was good.  I've never seen the amount of fanaticism reddit has for the movie outside of reddit.  
- He uses his nose to smell crime
- That's Bruce Willis the whole time. 
- If rated anything more than R the middle aged women who made it successful would condemn it amongst their circles as too risqué.
- Because the sexual stuff in Fifty Shades of Gray was targeted at women, so the movie could literally been rape porn and it still would gotten an R. (oh wait...)
- No, it definitely wasn't.  I think there were like 2 real sex scenes, both incredibly tame.  Honestly, it was a really boring movie.
- Bite your tongue! Showgirls was a masterpiece. 
- Especially bad because it was incredibly successful during its opening weekend.

The 'wide release' of Showgirls was smaller than the 'wide release' for an R-rated movie. It opened at #2 in the box office and made a lot more per screen than the R-rated film that opened at #1. The problem was word of mouth.

People are willing to see NC-17 movies, but the fuckwits in suits aren't willing to make them because the last one was bad. Imagine if we retired any of the other ratings just because a film beneath them went down the tubes?
- Fuck yeah! Hadn't heard about that
- I doubt Disney would allow it to be R. There is tons of merchandise directed at children. If only 18+ people saw it no one would buy a groot plushie. 


Now if your talking a punisher movie then please rated R or don't even make it. 
- you got a problem with a bunch of friends holding hands? </sarcasm>

- I'm just tired of the same formulaic ending that you find in so many movies. 

The hero(es) make an assault at the main force of the bad guys that's so crazy it just might work. They fight their way through the enemies until you reach the leader. 

Fight the bad guy, and things look rough for the heroes. Then, through sheer effort, they make what looks like a killing blow on the leader! 

But wait! It didn't work! He's too powerful! And now the leader is doing something that makes it look like everything is doomed! There's no way the hero(es) can stop him now!

And then they stop him! Hooray!


- MCU formula : Characters beat villain in some manner or form indirect to beating the ever-loving crap out of him. One character dies in order to accomplish this. Character comes back as a potted plant 5 minutes later(groot, bucky, iron-man 3, etc). Which is always weird because the collateral damage and general loss of life in some of these movies is massive but god forbid any merchandise get killed.
- Nope, not at all, I responded to something down thread that answers this. Gunn is solid. 
- I'm guessing if the movie was rated R he wouldn't have been asking for that guy's leg. 
- He'd be kind of like Ted the bear.
- To add to that, as a huge fan of the comic book GotG (the 2006-2010ish run, not the new movie based run), I'd love an R rated Annihilation movie. (Annihilation spoiler warning from here on out) Seeing Richard Rider kill Annihilus by sticking his arm down Annihilus's throat and tearing his guts inside out (or for another Annihilation moment, Drax punching straight through Thanos's chest and tearing out his still beating heart) would be the most amazing movie climax ever, and depicting the Annihilation War as bloody, horrifying and nearly hopeless would be awesome. The issue I see with doing such a movie as R is that it's a turning point for the entirety of Marvel cosmic (so is kind of necessary viewing for cosmic fans), and the characters involved aren't all that R rated most of the time, so you'd have PG-13 movies before it (like the original) and after it but a crucial R rated movie smack dab in the middle.
- Rocket's Bad Fur Day
- Mmm... Eccentrica Gallumbits.
- Aw yeahhh,  right next to the one tit lady from Kung Pow
- "Three tits? Awesome".
- That's what I used to do but it's risky on opening weekend for a film like Deadpool because they're extra strict since they know tons of kids are going to pull that trick. In fact, that happened to a couple of kids when I saw it this weekend. They were denied tickets at the front because they were too young so they bought tickets to Zoolander instead, went into Deadpool and a few minutes later someone walked in and told them to go to the correct theater. 
- Most theaters around here have assigned seating,  so you can't really theatre hop the way we used to.
- Sainsburys. Fucking Sainsburys. I was 17 and tried to buy Wreck-It Ralph on Blu-Ray. They asked for ID. I was stunned. The film is rated PG, which isn't enforceable by law (the only enforceable age ratings in the UK are 12 and above). I was completely befuddled. Sainsburys have officially lost it when it comes to age ratings. 
- Take a look at the Québec Régie du cinéma website. http://www.rcq.gouv.qc.ca/RCQ221FilmClasseRecent.asp  

The only recent movie that is 16+ is "Fifty Shades of Black", for vulgar language. "Deadpool" is 13+ (violence and vulgar language).  

Most movies are G or 13+. Not a lot of 16+ movies there... Québec is pretty european in its movie rating.
- I remember as a small town kid in the 90s our local movie theater had no concept of restricting R movies to younger customers.  I saw so many great R movies in theaters with my buddies and we were preteens.  I specifically remember when I moved to a different city, and tried to see Pitch Black in theaters they wouldn't sell me the tickets.  I was so confused as there is no law against it and they were enforcing their policy for no understandable reason.  Regardless I bought a ticket for some other movie and walked into the R flick regardless.  

Actually now that I think about it, once they started successfully policing R movie entrances, I went to significantly less movies.  This lead to underage drinking.  So, let's conclude that preventing the youth from seeing R movies leads to underage drinking.
- Herbert West: Reanimator seems like all we got, sometimes :(
- John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness with Sam Neill was pretty acceptable
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noClMggb9R4
- Hollywood is a constant fight between directors and other creative people trying to make the best film they can, and the financiers and everyone else just wanting to get paid as much as possible.  
- Someone just watched *Hail Caesar!*
- I only bought True Lies on Video because I was too young to see it in theatre.  R ratings could up V.O.D. rentals and purchases the same way it drove me to Blockbuster Video back in the day.
- It started to a certain extent in 1999, with the backlash over Columbine and media violence.
- *Kick-Ass* and *The Secret Service* **(EDIT: the comics, for clarification)** are both clearly aimed at adults and the movies had to fit with the source material. R rated adaptations of these were inevitable.

Comparing Deadpool to these two doesn't really make sense, since the vast majority of his comic appearances are basically PG. I would put him more in the same category as Blade, Punisher, and Wolverine, who are similarly violent characters who generally appear in similar types of books. Staying true to the level of violence in most of their mainstream comic appearances would give you a PG-13 movie easily. However, film is a different medium and some elements don't translate as well. It's hard to sell a violent character if most of the violence is off screen. For this reason, R-rated adaptations of these characters' stories (Blade, Punisher, and Deadpool) tend to be better than PG-13-rated ones (Wolverine).

TL;DR *Deadpool* did need to be rated R, but not for the same reasons as *Kick-Ass* and *Kingsman*.

EDIT: Sorry. I know that wasn't the main point of your comment, but the implication in the way you listed those together just kind of bugged me.
- I agree that they don't need to be anything more than PG-13, but I do think they should be more 13 than PG.  The problem I have with the PG-13 comic book movies is the blatant pandering to children.  I feel like it's pointless and takes away from the film for no good reason.  Kids will still like it and want to see it without pandering to them with little moments specifically aimed at kids.
- The opening to that book was just a massively epic intro. The rain and them bringing that guy in via helicopter followed by the Dr. sending in the flesh sample for analysis. Just awesome.
- I first read it when I was around 8-9. Then when the Lost World came out my dad read that first before giving it to me. I still remember him telling me one breakfast, "then there's this guy who gets eaten by a bunch of baby t-rexes!"

I was hooked.
- I think we still need an MPAA, so that a 7 year old isn't taken to TDK in IMAX (old example, I know). I think we need an R-15 for movies Like Mad Max: Fury Road and The Dark Knight.
- An organization that rates content is not useless, parents don't have time to thoroughly research every bit of media their children consume.  Or for that matter individuals to research the content of media they are comfortable paying to consume themselves.  However I do not like how much power the mpaa has come to wield over the industry, and how content creators bend to appease them.  I'm really not sure how to achieve any sort of middle ground in that situation.  
- Or you can be in the army but not be allowed to buy call of duty is a common one
- Hell, Cloverfield had a woman implode behind a curtain. If you slowed the footage down, you can see rib ages and stuff.  
Also, a couple moments before that, you see a dead soldier with his chest open, blood and bones and stuff, implying that he also imploded.   
Totally didn't expect that in a PG-13 film.
- You can say fuck one time in a PG-13 movie.  Say it more than that, R.  A great example of this is 'The Martian'. Damon's character clearly says fuck at one point in the movie, then at another point when he get's bad news from NASA, the camera cuts to outside of the rover vehicle at the moment he is about to exclaim fuck. You can see him lip it and say it many times, but you can't hear it.  

The book also has the character say fuck quite a bit, and given the circumstances and human nature, it fit really well. 
- This comment has been rated NC-17 by the MPAA for disturbing language, adult themes, and a scene depicting hate speech.
- [deleted]
- it's not, this guy has no idea what a blockbuster is.

he thinks every movie that did okay at the theaters is a blockbuster.
- I did an IMDB search on rate R feature films released with US country of origin for these years:

1980 103  
1985 147  
1990 251  
1995 323  
2000 321  
2005 311  
2010 300  
2015 218  
- Yeah, there are. You're just ignoring the R rated movies releasing now and misremembering the ones from decades ago. 
- [deleted]
- The MPAA should be abolished. It's a terribly run organization that is well past it's usefulness. For anyone who hasn't seen *This Film Is Not Yet Rated* watch it. It's an extremely well-made and enjoyable documentary about the MPAA and how the ratings system "works". It was on Netflix when I watched it...not sure if it still is.
- But with Mo Money, Mo problems.
- You can't be serious. 
- That dude in the hair piece? That was Bruce Willis the whole time!
- Those shorts make no sense to me but maybe he has a good reason for them.
- chicka chicka
- I don't take the shits, I just stir them.
- Pisses me off that I only learned about it after it went to Netflix.

Did they only have $100 for marketing or something?
- Which part?
- I didn't even know it existed until over a year after it came out.
- It was the best 3D I saw personally up until Fury Road.
- I know I had no interest in it due to 3D at the time.  Love it when I rented it at home.
- He nose the truth
- > middle aged women who made it successful would ~~condemn it amongst their circles as too risqué.~~ have to admit that it is literally just porn and nothing else.


- Wow. Just, I mean it makes sense, but it also makes me realize how ridiculous that is.
- Absolutely.

Paul Verhoeven can do no wrong.
- Don't get me wrong, I think Guardians was perfect as it was. I was just a little confused by his point that James Gunn wouldn't be a good person to make it an R if that was the direction they wanted to go in. 
- That isn't true I know many 18 year olds who would buy a groot plushie. 
- >  If only 18+ people saw it no one would buy a groot plushie.

*slowly raises hand*


 



^I ^would ^totally ^buy ^a ^Groot ^plushie


- 24 year old here who definitely owns a groot plushie.

So soft. 
- > If only 18+ people saw it no one would buy a groot plushie.
> 

Just saw Deadpool today. There were a *lot* of really young kids in there with their parents. I saw one couple who had three kids who all had to be under 10.

- The problem with movie 1 is you have to spend so much time understanding hero, the villain becomes one dimensional.   Compare Ra's al Ghul and scarecrow to Joker and Two-Face in the Batman movies.    The second movie is more about the Joker and his mission than Batman, and better for it, but only because the audience knows Batman so well. 
- All marvel movies
- God, that GotG ending was terrible. It's was literally the anime thing of "lets kill god with *friendship*!"
- Sounds like every dnd boss I've ever fought. 
- That part would be the same, but Chris Pratt's character probably wouldn't have paid the guy for his leg.
- .. and he probably would have made something with it.
- It's the same, but he's pointing at a guy without a bionic leg.
- Hey, I just watched GotG for the third or fourth time yesterday, not at all familiar with the comics. What leads to Drax being able to tear out Thanos' heart? Is Thanos weakened a ton from other stuff, or is Drax empowered, or is the power of all the characters a lot different in the comics compared to the movie?
- You make Annihilation sound like a gore-fest and literally 90% of the violence was alluded to or happened off-panel.
- See that's where they fucked up. Should have started out with zoolander and never mentioned deadpool. Rookie mistake
- Really? Never seent that
- I got ID'ed for a lottery ticket in Morrison's the other day. You have to be 16 to buy a lottery ticket. And I'm 31...
- Sadly we live in a country where a small number of people kick off about minor things like that and big companies are too worried about their PR to tell these people to fuck off.

Personally I'd like a more relaxed approach. More so with cinemas, but I think they should adopt a system similar to the 12A with 15 and 18 rated films.
- heh :)

It does sound like the logline to my old business of film course
- yea i think having a rating makes sense. just not the mpaa. have a more standard rating system.
- I think the only thing it lacks is transparency.  Shine a little light up in there, and everything will just shake right on out.
- Parents can stop trying to bubble-wrap their children then. 13 year old kids say "fuck" more often than most R rated movies.

Or they can use sites like IMDB which tells you what kind of content is in the movie and approximately who it'd be appropriate for.
- Exactly. A far better comment on ratings than mentioning the ability to have a child. Now if the debate was pornography then absolutely the legal age for consent is a strange issue, I can fuck hundreds of 16 year olds and watch myself defile them but I can't make a video of it nor receive a photo of her tits even if the day before I came all over them (disclaimer being that I don't do this but legally here COULD). Ratings / legal ages and real life don't always see eye to eye and can be a rather odd thing.
- Still different degrees. There's a world of difference between violence in LOTR versus violence in 300, but I wouldn't call the first pure fantasy violence. It's not a thing where a binary evaluation would give a fair assessment... especially since you would STILL need someone to evaluate it and confirm the content. 
- I'm pretty sure blockbuster went out of business.
- You're ignoring all the R-rated franchises from the 80s and 90s that have had recent installments tamed down to PG-13.
- You want to get ahead?
- Charlie, that's not what the twist in the Sixth Sense was. Forget it, let's just push past it. 
- thats not the twist charlie
- But it turns out he's a security guard.... instead.
- Happy *international women's day *
- Maximum effort!
- Me too man. I watched it on my shitty TV, and was still blown the fuck away by how good it was. It was intense, and beautiful. It seemed like it was actually trying. My cousin walked by and was frozen for a good while because it was just that good. Yet neither of us had even heard of it. They need to make another one with the same care and passion. I feel like there have been a ton of movies like this too. Edge of Tomorrow? I'm really starting to think Hollywood doesn't actually want our money as much as they pretend to.
- Gravity beats Fury Road in my humble opinion. I feel like the only way to properly watch Gravity is in a theater in  3D.
- i still regret not seeing it in 3d. for that matter, i regret not seeing it twice. and a third time. and maybe a fourth.

- That's a shame because all the slow mo lighting effects were amazing in 3D. 
- The twist is, we are going to show [Full Penetration](http://imgur.com/ndtDoOv)
- HIS WHOLE HEAD IS A NOSE
- Funny enough, the main complaint that I heard from people was that they went in expecting it to essentially be smut and they were disappointed by how weak it was.
- They must not have seen Super....or anything Gunn has made
- What if my problem is lack of friends?
- Ra's al Ghul isn't the greatest example of one dimensional villains. I'll give you the scarecrow though. 
- It's a mixture of Drax is generally stronger (though not by much, since this was just after he got a huge nerf from his original Superman like power level to what he was depicted as in the movie), and the fact that Drax gets a huge buff against fighting Thanos, since he was literally created to *destroy* (thus being called Drax the Destroyer) Thanos. Drax normally isn't strong enough to beat Thanos level enemies, he's just super effective against Thanos himself. It's also worth noting Thanos's power level varies depending on his favor with Death, as in this story Thanos was in good standing with Death after attempting to make amends for his past crimes and therefore Death was willing to accept him with open arms, whereas later (Thanos didn't stay dead because, spoiler alert, Adam Warlock realized he needed Thanos as the counter to Adam Warlock's evil side Magus, as Thanos is the Avatar of Death and Warlock is the Avatar of Life, and so Warlock rescued him by placing Thanos in one of Warlock's regenerative cocoons) Drax tried to kill Thanos again with an antimatter weapon which instantaneously disintegrated Thanos (aside from his skeleton) and Thanos survived this far more grievous injury easily (he regenerated in seconds) because he was at this point being shunned by Death.

- Totally, they couldn't have been more obvious. It was 430 and Zoolander wasn't playing until 6 yet they bought the tickets and walked right in. Also, this was a small theater where everything is clustered together and is never packed so they had no way to disappear or blend in with the crowd. They have much to learn.  
- Yeah, no theater I've been to has that. Lucky me, I guess.
- The Daily Mail and to a lesser extent the Sun are to blame with their "every form of media but the papers must be regulated" attitude.
- >13 year old kids say "fuck" more often than most R rated movies.

Source:  Xbox live.  I have been called some of the worst combinations of insults by 12 year olds on call of duty, usually before they rage quit.

I know you said 13 year olds, but barring some form of extreme intervention of darwinism, I assume the same 12 year old who referred to me as "nigger-faggot" would grow up to be the 13 year olds you refer to.
- Fools who run their mouth oft wind up dead.
- Yup. The 3D shined in this movie during all the slow mo scenes. Enough to warrant two visits to the theater from me. 
- I wrote it off due to the rash of shit 3D films that were coming out.  Honestly, none the trailers did the movie any justice.
- [deleted]
- He wasn't written superbly which is sad, because Cillian Murphy played it SO WELL. The character kicked ass, it just needed like... 10-15 more minutes of screen time.

Compare that to The Scarecrow presented in Batman: Arkham Asylum, which completely stole the show by being fucking great on minimal time because there was NO dimension to the character. He just showed up from time to time and absolutely changed the game with no rhyme or reason, some monster was fucking with Batman and that was that.
- Thanos was actually being a dick and helped Annihilus capture Galactus to use him as a power source. He was convinced by Moondragon (said gay dragon) that Annihilus was going to wipe out everything in the universe as well as the Negative Zone and Thanos decided he didn't like that. Right as he was about to free Galactus is when Drax showed up and killed him.

I love Annihilation.
- In Chicago it's widespread. Only boutique places do random seating now. It's actually phenomenal, but then again I don't have to worry about my age. 
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
- Ok, I'll just go build a lair.
- SHOWTIME! 
- Make sure to have automatic doors that open in cool ways with awesome sound effects and blinking lights. And to have your computer chair's back be facing that door, so when the protagonists enter you can dramatically turn and look at them.

==================================================
Post Title: James Cameron attempted to buy the rights to the novel "Jurassic Park", but Spielberg beat him by a few hours. He described his version as "'Aliens' with dinosaurs."
Author: derstherower
Score: 49720
Content:


--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- He should have bought Congo when he had the chance.
- I bet Cameron would have made Hammond more like the book version, a greedy, corporate type instead of the grandfatherly type we got from Spielberg.
- Probably would have been a little more faithful to the novel, would have loved to see his take on it although Spielberg obviously did it justice too.

Edit: Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time, some people are thinking I’m talking down on it. Just saying Cameron’s take would have been interesting too.
- Everyone is acting like this would have been terrible. I just imagine this run:

(1984) The Terminator 

(1986) Aliens

(1989) The Abyss

(1991) Terminator 2

and then

(1993) Jurassic Park

The run up to Jurassic Park would have been some of the most fantastic sci-fi/sci-fi horror/sci-fi action ever put on film. I have all the faith in the world that he would have pulled off Jurassic Park masterfully. It wouldn't have been the same movie but I don't doubt that it would have been great.
- Aliens vs. Dinosaurs... We were so close to living in a world where that existed. 
- [deleted]
- Isn't Aliens with dinosaurs just Dino Crisis?
- You could make that film and slap the Dino Crisis label on it and it'd work
- I had a similar idea for a book myself a while back, mine was about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques. I call it *Billy and the Cloneasaurus*.
- This isn't exactly true.  Cameron may have wanted the rights but Crichton had agreed to have Spielberg direct JP before the book even came out.  One on the agreements that was made by Crichton was he would sell to Spielberg only if he directed.
- I love Cameron's movies but I agree with him, he would not have been the right fit for this one.

Kids love dinosaurs. I remember loving them as a kid. And it's that sentimental touch and appreciation for the dinosaurs that I feel helps enhance the original Jurassic Park.

None of the sequels have had that vibe. They only present the dinos like Godzilla or monsters. Jurassic World attempted with the raptors but it was overkill. 
- Personally, I'd take a James Cameron sequel to Jurassic World over 7 more Avatar movies any day

It's never too late James
- 8 year old me thought the current version was scary enough 
- Dr. Malcolm: "Uhh...the game is over, folks. The game is...over."
- I love Spielberg's vision, but I don't think this would have sucked. We consider Jurassic Park this marvel of special effects, suspense, and storytelling. This is the version we were given and fell in love with. James Cameron would have done this justice. If he had made the movie, that's the movie we would have loved too. If the shoe was on the other foot, we would be saying that Spielberg would have turned it into some shitty kid's adventure film. Comparing it to ET and Goonies. 
- Spielberg...uh...finds a way. 
- Why doesn’t Cameron still make that film but title it something different?
- I'm glad Spielberg did it. Dinosaurs deserve the wonder that Spielberg brought, not a Crichton or Aliens style horror feel. We needed the joyful moments with the apatosauruses.
- He also pitched the sequel to ‘Alien’ by writing 

#Alien$ 

On a whiteboard. 
- [removed]
- The dinosaurs would've been fucking monsters had Cameron made the original JP in his vision. 

The newer movies with Chris Pratt certainly seem to be taking that direction, which i like, considering that they technically are monsters if Dr. Wong was to be believed from the last movie.
- I would have loved to see Mouldoon fight a T-REX in a power loader. 
- I don't want 'Aliens with Dinosaurs'. I want *Jurassic Park with Aliens*.
- James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron.
- I feel his would have been too adult and would have robbed generations of kids from their first borderline horror movie.
- James Cameron's Jurassic Park would have started Ellie, she would have had Grant's arch of learning to love kids, the military would have come in at some point, Hammond would have been the big bad. I'm just guessing because, I like Cameron don't get me wrong  but metaernity as strength, corporate bad guys, and military forces are the three pillars of a Cameron film. 
- Some parts of Jurassic World did kinda remind me of Aliens, specifically when they send that security team out to take care of the Indominus Rex and they all get picked off while observers watch the team's personal cameras. I thought the sequel could have gone in that direction, with a shady project to breed super raptors, and a military team + Chris Pratt getting trapped in some high tech facility fighting for their lives.  
- I'm glad he didnt, personally. Jeff Goldblum wouldn't of been casted.
- Interesting. I loved the book, and Spielberg's interpretation of the book. Always wondered how it would have been as a horror film rather than sci-fi thriller. Then again, Spielberg's version has so many memorable moments. 
- Thank God Spielberg got the rights first. 


- "He described his version as *Aliens* with ______" seems like an excellent template for jokes about the plots of movies.

He described *Titanic* as *Aliens* with icebergs. He described *Terminator* as *Aliens* with robots.

Jordan Peele described *Get Out* as his version of *Aliens* with suburbanite white people.

Iñárritu described *The Revenant* as his version of *Aliens* with bears.
- Actually, I would rather have seen Cameron do the movie adaptation for Sphere.
- Goddamn he would've been fucking amazing with Congo. That movie has such a great premise, a pretty good book, but the movie is flaming vomit.
- Which would have been a mistake, imo. Big part of why JP 1 works so well is that you feel the excitement and enthusiasm of the ultimately misguided humans in charge. You can relate because, hey,  it's fucking *dinosaurs* and they're so cool! His heart is in the right place but he's too naive/confident to see the enormity of what he's meddling with. He's humanity in a nutshell.
- probably would have spared some expense too...
- I actually finished the book two days ago and that was one of the most jarring character differences between book and movie. I HATED him by the end of the book. Towards the end when he's sitting in the room with Malcolm and the vet and he's thinking about how he'll do it again and blaming Muldoon and Arnold I was praying he would get eaten. So glad he did.

Oh and Lex was fucking awful.

Edit: To anybody whining about a spoiler I don't care, the book is 28 years old, after that long you don't get to complain.
- I much prefer the Spielberg/Attenborough John Hammond though to be honest.
- *Miracle on 34th Street* John Hammond.
- [deleted]
- Cameron should just make a Dino Crisis movie. Then everyone gets what they want!
- I mean, the author himself did the screenplay and deemed the changes necessary. Some parts of the book were kind of meh and definitely shouldn't be there (except maybe not kill the lawyer who was a pretty alright dude and kill the guy who actually deserved it)
- >Spielberg obviously did it justice too

A bit of an understatement.
- I would like that in general. Not remakes, but 2 movies made at the same time about the same story, just to see how they diverge
- Man, its such a shame that Cameron doesn't work more. He has a real skill for grounding scifi in the real world and making it believable. I would be happy if he did a few failed movies if he just worked a bit more consistently.
- It would have been amazing, no doubt.
- [deleted]
- People like to shit on Cameron because of Avatar and Titanic but the dude is one of the best directors of the last 30 years. Infact if there is one director other than Spielberg who could have pulled it off, it's Cameron.
- A xenomorph hatched from a *T. rex* or a raptor would be terrifying.
- With Bill Paxton as Dr. Malcolm.

^(RIP Hudson)
- Arnold is Muldoon. He's now a much bigger character and he fights several raptors with his bare hands. 
- Okay

right

but

picture this

buddy cop movie

with the og Muldoon and Michael Beihn

they have wacky adventures and hunt dinosaurs

not sure why I felt the need to make this comment in greentext format but what's done is done
- Biehn would be Dr Grant, Paxton would be Dr Malcolm and Weaver would be Dr Sattler.

Shit that would be fucking awesome.
- I was gonna say someone needs to tell Jim about Turok
- The original Jurassic Park is a movie about people that uses dinosaurs to explore humanity’s role in the world. Every sequel is about CGI dinosaurs with some people in it. 
- I don't know, I guess it depends on his mindset for the film. If "*Aliens* with Dinos" was his mindset, I could see how this would *not* be a good fit for him. What I loved about Spielberg's *JP* was the wonder and amazement you felt in seeing the dinosaurs for the first time. I'll be goddamned if I still don't get a little teary eyed when they first see the Brontosaurus(?) on the island and John William's score ramps up and I just feel like a little kid again, amazed at the magic of feeling what its like to see, what felt like, a *real* dinosaur on screen. 

If Cameron could've had the same mindset for *JP* that he had in *Titantic*, giving us the same sense of wonder and beauty of the ship and the scope of the tragedy, I think he could've nailed it! 

Shit would probably look pretty fucking dope in James Cameron 3D too! lol

Edit - Changed James Horner to John Williams because I fucked it up... royally. 
- IDK man, Avatar is like his calling and passion project, something he dreamt about doing for decades. I really wanna see him running wild with his imagination than adapt an existing story.
- "I like to uhhh.. keep this theory for uhh.. close encounters" 
- [removed]
- And in my book it's still one of the best sequels ever.
- It was a bit more action/adventure, but I thought it had a good share of suspense and horror.
- I'm glad they brought back BD Wong. He actually does play a pretty good villain. 
- Here's the thing; Spielberg shows them as magnificent creatures of wonder that none of us will ever get to experience for real. Cameron would show them as a force of fucking nature that was once the dominant species of the planet and would make us feel glad that we didn't exist during that time.
- So Space Jam. 
- thank god you didn't have Ripley riding a motorcycle around with a pack of xenomorphs
- I’m definitely happy with the film we got but I’d definitely be interested in seeing Cameron's version. 
- No kidding. Jurassic Park is one hell of a movie and expands on what SS did 20 years prior with Jaws, taking all these elements which, in any other movie, would not play nice with each other and making them work extraordinarily well.
- Sounds like he only has one idea.
- That would have been a perfect fit, but he already kind of did *Sphere*. It was called, *The Abyss*. 
- Or Andromeda Strain (which is still my favorite Crichton novel).
- The movie features Tim Curry doing a terrible Borat impression the whole time. It's amazing. 
- I will forever defend this movie for three reasons:

Bruce Campbell, Delroy Lindo and Tim Curry.
- [deleted]
- But, hear me out, we wouldn't have gotten the best line in cinema history.
- you ever see the interview with Bruce Campbell talking about getting the pitch for the roll.
It's like, ok, its based off the book written by the guy that wrote Jurassic Park. It's being produced by Kathleen Kennedy. It has an all star cast and big budget. Interested? 
Congratulations you just made Congo! 
- >Mr. Homolka, stop eating my sesame cake...

For that scene alone, I'm glad he didn't make *Congo*.
- I sincerely hope that you’re not counting Tim Curry as flaming vomit, he showed a masterclass of acting in that film.


- "Stop eating my SESAME CAKE!"
- K but I love Congo though
- > movie is flaming vomit

someone missed the scene where they were shooting a laser at gorillas in a flaming volcano city
- I’ve heard it’s hilarious 
- His flea circus monologue is one the best moments of the film and gives you a glimpse of the man who bit off more than he can chew.
- The music matches the excitement. You would need a totally different score if Hammond is different. 
- Yeah, and really when you look at it, it is there a bit anyway, its just not so hamfisted as it could have been.  That makes Hammond a better developed character.  Most "evil" people arent totally evil from their own perspective, and its totally appropriate that we see Hammond from his own perspective.  It all goes to shit anyway so the point is there.   Hell even the bad guy in Jurassic park is actually this pitiful, pathetic man, not some ham fisted comic book villain like in the Jurassic World movies.  Hammond's greed is still there, his blindness to the repercussions of his actions.  In the end, he isn't really expressing regret over all the people that died as much as he is backing off the release date... Kind of like how Zuckerberg is reacting to data abuses--he just doesn't fully get it, even in public.  Or how leadership behind recent self-driving car fatalities are acting.
- Just imagine him as Burke from Aliens, it would've been an interesting dynamic. 
- [deleted]
- >You can relate, because, hey,  it's fucking *dinosours* 

Tart-ranou-sour-us Rex

- That was my one gripe about westworld, we didn't see enough of the park under normal circumstances to fall in love with it the way we do in jp. I think it's a tougher sell because we instantly connect with the wonder of nature, even more with "nature unattainable" of dinosaurs, and WW is derived from experiences, and people driven, which is less dramatic. We see Dr. Ford's wistful love affair with it, but not quite our own before the horns start to sound and the walls start to come down. 
- He gets eaten in the book? That's satisfying.
- Lex was a realistic child in the book which I found interesting, but yeah she was annoying as he'll. 
- Not to mention to flip flop of age between the boy and girl. I was like, whyyyyyy the change in dynamic??

Dr. Grant and the kids attempting to get to the boat, the Rex chasing them down, swimming after them, and then chasing them down the river was one of my favorite parts of the book.  
- Spoiler! We’ve got spoiler here!!!

See? Nobody cares.
- The entirety of the jurassic park post from last week in /r/books was mostly about the book differences and how shitty lex was lol. For real though that was the most accurate depiction of a child I've seen in the worst place ever
- >I actually finished the book two days ago

>To anybody whining about a spoiler I don't care, the book is 28 years old
- Spielberg's take had his trademark childhood wonder with the John Williams score, story arc of Grant and the kids, happy ending, etc. Cameron would have made more of a technical fiction with a focus on the ethical issues of mankind manipulating great technology with an emphasis on the bare survival of the characters. Spielberg's version worked, but I would have loved to see Cameron make Jurassic Park look more like The Abyss. 

Spielberg's version probably made more money with the family friendly appeal and merchandising opportunities. Cameron has always made distinctly adult movies. 
- Totally agree, I just think Cameron’s tone would have been a lot more like the book, like when they first get to the island they already know shit has gone horribly wrong even before they check it out because Grant sees the added safety bars on his windows that weren’t in the original blueprints. TLW book was really butchered and I’m not a huge fan of the movie although the first half is still pretty good and I actually liked the T Rex in San Diego scenes.
- Not killing off Hammond in the first one kinda changed a major part of TLW's premise from the book.
- I'd be ok with a more realistic version where the raptor grabs her and rips her apart in front of the family. 
- > That screenplay is like 90% different from the book. 

It's not like the book was all that great TBH. Crichton obviously only wrote it because someone paid him a ton of money to do it, and he obviously wrote it with an eye towards being a sequel to the movie and being easily adaptable into a movie. He threw a dead character onto an unmentioned island mostly so he could feature dinosaurs that weren't on the first island, and offered half baked reasons for it because he couldn't just straight up say "casting and merchandising". Which makes it weirder they didn't use more of the book in the movie, but I really don't think anything that great was lost. A cool Carnotaurus scene, that's pretty much it.

IMHO the crime when it comes to this series is that *Crichton set up an amazing sequel at the end of the book and then didn't use that at all*. Jurassic Park (the book) opened with the fact that procompsognathus had gotten off the island and ended with clear evidence that Raptors had too. The sequel should have centered around hunting raptors in the Costa Rican jungle and trying to figure out what to do with the ones on isla nublar. I still want to read *that* sequel.

Meanwhile if you're writing a straight sequel to the movie, then Jurassic World was a much more logical place to go. There's no way anything that happened in the first movie would have stopped a corporation with billions to throw around from opening the park anyway more or less as it was originally conceived.
- I really wished a true-to-book version of The Lost World would be made. IMO it was better than Jurassic Park (the book).
- Both movies took a lot of liberties with the children's characters. In JP Tim was originally the one good with computers while Lex was a whiny spoiled brat who kept getting them into trouble.  In Lost World, they took the male child out altogether. The only thing they kept from him was his race, switching Ian's daughter to being black.  I remember something about the gymnastics from the book, but I think it was something along the lines of "dad never comes to my gymnastics tournaments."
- Was it really that bad that it tilts the whole movie for you into the water? And by a similar vein lotta people hold the dream raptor in JP3 in that regard. 

I totally understand: they're quite ridiculous for the movies they were in. But these are sequences which breeze through in less than a minute, and yet some people treat them as if they were the greatest offenders or something. Maybe they were just the straws that broke the camel's back, but I do find it ridiculous that some people are holding it over their heads every time the subject of the sequels comes up. At least they're not glaring plot holes that cause the movie to fall apart when brought to scrutiny.
- I just want a proper sequel to the games. If they could do a reboot like they did with RE7 I would fucking pre-order that shit 12 times over. 
- Well, that's definetly Aliens with dinosaurs so...lol.  
- My understanding was that he only wrote the book in order to get to write the movie. The two were very much parts of the same project.
- So Armageddon and Deep Impact, or Antz and A Bug's Life?
- What do you mean? You don't want Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5?
- the problem is that his work is great because he takes his time. Steven, regrettably, pumps out a lot of junk for each winner.
- Well you're in luck my friend, because you can look forward to 4 more Avatar movies from now until 2025! /s

- Game Over Man!  This is chaos!
- RIP Bill Pullman
- Now THIS needs to be done!
- What's a really important distinction is that the first one used practical effects, including an animatronic T-Rex that took like half the budget for the movie.

That's why the effects hold up. I wish Hollywood would try and explore that medium more, but they'd all rather churn out CGI-fests for cheaper.
- > James Horner's score 

Nothing wrong with Horner, but with Spielberg its always John Williams doing the score.
- Brachiosaurus*

(sorry, my ten-year-old dinosaur elitism is shining through)
- Judged by the first Avatar movie imagination doesn't seem to be his strength.
- [removed]
- Me too.  It's a nice little touch of continuity as well.
- Yeah, at the end of the day it’s still James Cameron. His version would have been great too, but for other reasons. 
- I could definitely see Cameron get a little closer to the source material. Muldoon firing rocket launchers at a T-Rex definitely feels right up his alley. Hell, I love the movie but he easily could have had the better version.
- Cameron said he wanted to treat the dinosaurs like monsters. 

Which I think is the wrong approach. That approach misses the elements of dinosaurs that have captured our collective attention. There’s a reason we love Dinos, and it’s not just monstrosity. 
- The Abyss was better than Sphere, but can't remember the faces of the cast of Abyss other than the female lead (whose name I can't remember). Dustin Hoffman, OTOH, is unforgettable in Sphere as he is in everything else he does.
- I always hated The Abyss as a kid, because I would sometimes start watching it thinking it was The Sphere, which was one of my favorite movies at the time.
- That book helped me realize how much I enjoy dry, procedural science fiction.  
- The movie they made in the '70s was pretty good but it suffered from the same thing the book did: a very anticlimactic ending. Very good otherwise.
- To this day, I still say “Diamond” and “ABSOLUTELY TRUE!” in the same accent Curry used in the movie.  So over the top and fun.
- "Nnnyesss" - Tim Curry
- I need to hunt down some making off stuff for the film. There has so to something from him somewhere going, "well the script looked awful but they offered me money, lots of it.so I thought I'd Ham it up"

- Tim Curry could play flaming vomit and it would be a masterclass of acting.
- I wasn’t even aware it’s considered a bad movie. Maybe some silly premise and plot points but it was fun and the SFX were cool for the time. The sentry gun scene was awesome. I loved it as a kid. 
- What an amazing scene... "when we have control..." 
- Great point. That score is so uplifting and hopeful, and I think that feeds heavily off of his character in particular
- This. I actually like it better that John was just a screw up. He was still responsible. In the aftermath, some would likely consider him greedy or evil. He cut corners while claiming to spare no expense. And had no business creating the raptors...they didn't even look like they had figured out how to use them in an exhibit. They were just this group of hyper intelligent killing machines that they kept around. 

We didn't need John wringing his hands or twirling a mustache while lamenting the involvement of meddling kids to hammer it home. In fact, the idea that this rich moron who cost lives may, also, have dreams and love his family is...ya know...realistic.
- Im quite amazed that you were able to use the word "hamfisted" in a sentence twice, without me thinking you over used it.
- I love what you said here about Hammonds development and portrayal. 

Just one note that self-driving cars are still much safer than human piloted ones. To me this is a knee jerk reverse Jurassic Park situation. Even with two fatalities on the books, Teslas on autopilot are much safer than humans on a per-mile-driven basis. Don’t know as much about the Uber one but I’d guess it’s got a similar track record since this is its first fatality. 
- Woah pump the brakes there on the car comparisons. Dinosaurs are a novelty, automated cars are a replacement for the texting/calling/raging/aggressive shit-show disaster that is human drivers. 
- "Frankly Hammond, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see the raptors fighting over a goddamn percentage."
- [deleted]
- In a very gruesome fashion. He falls down a hill a bit, just enough to immobilize his old body and bad knee, then the little dinosaurs from the movie sequel start nibbling on him. Their saliva has an opioid-like effect so he's thinking about how cute they are while they eat his face. I read the book decades ago and that's the one part I remember clearly, because in the book the old man and the lawyer are switched. The old man is an asshole and lawyer is actually a badass saving the kids like Malcolm in the movie. 
- Yep, Hammond got Dieter Stark'd before Dieter Stark was ever a character in the franchise.
- The movie is a pretty weird adaptation, in that the actual scenes and story are pretty close, but the characters are exact opposites and the ones that live die and the ones that die live.

It almost seemed like it was his entire goal.
- Consumed by his own ambitions.
- Dude, wait until you find out how Nedry went out in the book...

The dude was a jerk in the movie, but in the book, you kinda feel for him since Hammond and InGen were pretty much blackmailing him to work for him.
- She was also younger in the book. For the movie they kept Tim about the same age (11-ish), but changed Lex from 7-8 to 13-14. They also gave Tim's computer knowledge to Lex.
- She was a realistic depiction of an incredibly terribly behaved child, but yeah still realistic.
- Yeah I did love the river scene. Interesting to see that they put it back into JP3 with the Spinosaurus.
- Meh, at 6 I may have been stupid I knew better than to reach over the shoulder of the person trying to save everybody's life to interfere and push buttons for fun.
- >“But when I saw the film, I realised that I was not the right person to make the film, he was. Because he made a dinosaur movie for kids, and mine would have been aliens with dinosaurs, and that wouldn’t have been fair.

>”Dinosaurs are for 8-year-olds. We can all enjoy it, too, but kids get dinosaurs and they should not have been excluded for that. His sensibility was right for that film, I’d have gone further, nastier, much nastier.”

- James Cameron
- We just need Cameron to make Jurassic Parks. 

>They mostly come 65 million years ago. Mostly. 
- So Cameron's version would have been like a Crichton novel


- > Spielberg's version probably made more money with the family friendly appeal and merchandising opportunities. Cameron has always made distinctly adult movies.

Considering Avatar and Titanic, I'm not sure you can say Cameron version would have made less money.

- Trex in San Diego is almost all I ever remember of that movie, and the rain scene where the rexes eat the nice guy. The rest is always jarring when I go back and watch 
- Teach Malcolm a lesson in family and commitment.
- I didn't say The Lost World film was horrible. It just goes off the rails after that moment. It feels like two different movies and that moment begins with the raptor being killed. After that we get a B movie feel, hell we even have Japanese executives running away from a T-Rex like Godzilla.
- regina was thicc
- Doing some quick research it was more like the book was based on a screenplay he wrote in the 80's which he then rewrote as a book in 1990 which finally became a screenplay for the movie in 1993. So, I guess it just came full circle 
- Olympus has fallen and White house down.
- Ah, Avatar. The giant franchise that's not a franchise as it only has one movie in its entry released 10+ years ago.
- I heard the 6th one's going to have full penetration...
- Correct. 
- You know, despite the fact that I don't care about Avatar in the slightest, I'm curious what he plans to do with it. You don't just decide you're making 4 movies back to back in the same universe without having some big plans. Hopefully he learns from the (in my opinion pretty major) problems with the first story. 
- > the problem is that his work is great because he takes his time. Steven, regrettably, pumps out a lot of junk for each winner.

He makes more films, so he has a greater spectrum of ups and downs. Not to mention, I think Spielberg has more range than Cameron in terms of stories and direction (I can't see Cameron doing something like Schindler's List to the Adventures of Tintin to Lincoln to Bridge of Spies). 

I am also not a fan of Avatar on anything than technical appreciation, and I REALLY didn't like Titanic. Not to take away from Cameron as his first two Terminator films and Aliens are fantastic. 
- I wouldn't say Spielberg pumps out junk.  Even Spielberg by the numbers, like The Post, is still a very well made movie.
- that’s fuckin’ dope
- Unzips pants....
- it's literally just her holding her arms up like a t-rex and making dinosaur noises.

She still wins the Oscar, because she's so good at it.
- And THIS is podracing!
- It's insane how much better the effects for the original look than Jurassic World's. The CGI industry for major studios is just in an awful place right now. It's *capable* of great things but it all just gets handed off and sped up for cost/efficiency and out churns more generic, worse-looking junk.

Makes me wanna go back and watch all those featurettes on the LOTR extended edition DVDs again.
- That's not really why the effects hold up. The effects hold up because the special effects team had very little faith in how convincing the CGI would be. That's why they go above and beyond to convince you the dinosaurs were real.

There's a ton of CGI in Jurassic Park but for every single shot they carefully considered what would look better. CGI or practical. Broadly speaking, practical effects worked best for close ups where the texture and the real world presence of the suit or animatronic interacting with the real world is emphasised.

CGI worked best for full body shots where the animals moved, walked, turned, jumped etc. because CGI created far more fluid and convincing motion than suits, mechatronics and the discarded stop motion did.

But much more importantly, they spend almost half the movie convincing you the dinosaurs are real before the action starts.

It's stuff like...

* Showing the brachiosauruses interact with the world by pulling leaves from branches
* Seeing Grant lie on top of the sick triceratops while it breathes
* Having the rex eat a goat and drop a leg on the sunroof
* Seeing the little rex paw pull on the wire fence
* The vibrations in the glass of water
* The way the rex sinks into the mud and leaves a foot print that fills with water
* The way the rex's pupils react to the flashlight
* The way the rex blows off Grant's hat

Hell, the entire rex escape is in darkness and rain to blend the composited footage better.

Stan Winston once said that none of the effects (CGI or practical) looked anywhere near as good in broad daylight when you see the rex kill and eat the gallimumus (or any other part of the movie afterwards.

But it doesn't matter. At that point in the movie people have been thoroughly convinced that the dinosaurs are real forces in the world of this movie.

Practical effects aren't inherently better than CGI. The best result is still achieved by combining both. But what set JP's creatures well above any other movie is how much effort was put into making them convincing parts of their world instead of just popping them out when needed.
- There's an element of truth to that, but you can't forget that the first Jurassic Park did in fact use CGI, it just used it to blend the practical effects into the scenes, and not as a replacement for practical effects.
- *The Lost World* and *Jurassic Park III* had practical dinosaurs as well. 

So did *Jurassic World*, for that matter. But, for some reason that is beyond comprehension, they painted over a lot of the animatronics with CG. It's most notable with the raptors.
- > including an animatronic T-Rex that took like half the budget for the movie.

AND YET, Jurassic Park to this day is still a gold standard of how to properly use CGI and combine it with practical effects. CGI is a tool, not a crutch. Please don't contribute to its demonization.

It's overall a positive, except when used in the wrong places.
- Yeah, definitely this. The thing that gives the movie an element of wonder are the scenes where we get to see friendly dinosaurs. The Brontosaurus scene, for example, is something the makes one enjoy the setting. Actually hell, the whole first act before shit goes bad makes the film. The cool cars, the general anticipation of the main characters. 
- I think people are being too quick to make hard rules about this. Dinosaurs can be portrayed in any way people want. It's cool that we have Spielberg's dinosaurs but there's definitely still room for a movie like Cameron's version that uses them more like horror movie monsters.

- Ed Harris? He was great in that role. And although I can't recall the actors name, the military guy that got the bends I remember his face vividly. Especially the scene where he's slowly operating the chain pulley. A lot of great moments in that movie.
- Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio :)
- I loved it as a kid because you saw that lady’s boobs. 
- Man I dont knwmow why but the sphere scared the shit out of me as a kid. I didnt even know what was going on. I still dont know what it was about and I'm like 30.
- That just makes it seem more real.
- Eh-vry ward is ab-sew-lewt-le-leee Trew!
- Tim Curry is fucking legendary.
- I'm your great white hunter for this trip, who just happens to be black.
- One of my favorite quotes of all time.

- "You know it's the gorilla who's gonna get you across that border. Everybody in my country, is so afraid to be seen in an american movie, being cruel to a gorilla. This is the crazy world we live in...

Ok you can go!"


I feel like i could quote this movie word for word if i tried. 
- Man, that is pure Kafka 
- The movie is worth it for that scene alone.
- "DID YOU GET THE DIAMOND!!??"
- Oh man, I completely forgot where this line was from but I can perfectly picture the whole scene with Tim Curry and his full hamster-like mouth.
- It warms my heart to see so many people quoting this in this thread. 
- How come they had air conditioners for their tents back then but I still don't have one for mine? WTF kind of dystopian future is this??
- I’m glad someone liked it. The book was incredible, and used cutting-edge tech as a plot device. Really well done for being written in the late 70’s...but when I talked my friends into seeing it, and Amy ran down to chastise the gorillas trying to kill them with her speech gadget- *bad gorilla, bad gorilla*, they just cracked up laughing. I was mocked for talking them into it. 

Check out the book though. A completely different take on the same story, despite having a similar plot line. Cameron could have done wonders with it.
- Me too!  Joe Don Baker NEEDS those DIAMONDS for his LASERS DAMNIT!
- That was a cinematic masterpiece.
- My friends and I saw this in the theater. We still quote this scene at least every other month. That's how amazing this scene is. I love this movie for this scene alone. If someone says anything negative about this movie, I just show them this scene and their opinion on the movie gets slightly better.

- You never had control! That's the illusion!
- His line "Welcome, to Jurassic Park" with the iconic song playing 100% sets the tone.
- dun DUN, dun DUN

Dadadaaaa, da daaa da daaa
- Hammond reminds me a lot of King Kong's Carl Denham (disclaimer: I've only seen the Peter Jackson movie). "There is still some mystery left in this world, and we can all have a piece of it for the price of an admission ticket."
- It wasn’t hamfisted is what you’re saying.
- Man I love how Scott and Cameron created two of the strongest female protagonists on screen. Ripley and Sarah 4evr <3 <3 <3
- And the park failed in the book because of cocky assumptions about how effective their counting program was. "Stop counting after its reached the expected population" or something along those lines
- This is true, but it still shows a tendency in human nature towards nature; even though it’s just Nedry, there’s always that 1 guy, you know? The 1 guy that ruins it for everyone else. 
- The warden doesn't just live, Muldoon is the biggest badass in the book. When the fences go down, before the raptors are released, he leaves the bunker to hunt down the T-rex with nothing but a flask of whisky and a tranquilliser rifle.

When the raptors do get out, he doesn't skip a beat and switches out his weapon for a grenade launcher.
- What happened to the lawyer?
- And the reason he falls is because the kids are dicking around with with the computers and play sound clip of a T-Rex they use to scare other dinosaurs out of certain areas 
- Also, didn't Nedry's fate turn out more gruesome as well? It's been years since I listened to the book on tape (actual tape) and I seem to remember him getting disemboweled and holding his own intestines before he died.
- Do the raptors and t rex team up with burt macklin you son of a bitch and fist bump and eat shawarma at the end?
- compies (AKA procompsognathus)
- I wish my saliva had an opioid effect.
- > Their saliva has an opioid-like effect

wait what?
- sounds like Newman got the death Hammond was supposed to
- One of the scenes I remember most is Muldoon blowing a raptor in half with a rocket launcher. Like, holy shit why didn't he have a rocket launcher in the movie?
- > Their saliva has an opioid-like effect so he's thinking about how cute they are while they eat his face.

Hey, that's not bad. I wouldn't mind dying this way.
- I read Jurassic Park ten years ago and that part has really stuck with me - and I can barely remember what I had for breakfast yesterday. So well written.
- "oh balls"

His last words always stick with m for some reason.
- Clever girl?
- "let me have that radio!"

"NO ITS MINE I FOUND IT FIRST" 
- Oh man now I REALLY want to see what Cameron would have done
- James "Much Nastier" Cameron
- Did he forget they were selling Aliens toys to kids by 1990? I saw Aliens four years before Jurassic Park came out. The 80s and early 90s were kinda weird like that. 
- James Cameron isn't wrong. It's also fair that his take on the movie would have been a great film. 
- I remember at the time news reports saying this movie wasn't suitable for kids. Too much blood and too scary. 
- Haha how pissed would we have been 8 years old, amazing dinosaur movie, parents won't let us see it but that one kid whose parents smoke in the house gets to see it. I saw that movie in the theater with all my friends on my birthday, we got folders full of dinosaur facts and shit. Awesome
- I mean those are in line with Spielberg style. What Cameron's talking about would be more like aliens or maybe terminator. Not that those weren't money makers haha
- Neither of those films are 'R' rated.
- A giant monster rampaging through the city and Japanese tourists gaping in awe. What's not to like?
- Nah man it's got all the hunters, it's got the velociraptors in the grass, the scene where they have to be still while the TRex sniffs their pants hanging above them
- My favorite small detail was Jimmy Buffet saving his margaritas in JW.
- Babe and that other movie no one cares about
- I read an interesting observation that Avatar is the most successful film ever but its impact on pop culture is negligible. It's virtually never quoted or referenced.
- He left it wayy to long. Not only did the hype end 10 years ago, but everyone's completely fogotten about it.

He's left those sequels cooking on the burner way to long, we all got hungry and ordered takeout.
- But they will be in 4D! You will be able to smell them fucking this time.
- It's Jaaaaames Cameron, the bravest pioneeeeer!
- That's a different kind of movie. lol
- Hell yes!

I think the main reason that despite loving it by far the most as a kid ROTK is now my least favorite is because as Pellenor rolls around the CGI is just more and more obvious as time goes on.

As a kid if you'd asked me which battle was better between that and Helms deep I'd have scoffed 'ELEPHANTS'.

Now there's no question that Helms deep is the better filmed, acted and portrayed sequence. Seeing REAL water fall on REAL actors in REAL make up in REAL armor, I still believe they are Uruk-Hais. The fact that Jackson set it in the dark was also really clever. The moment where the ladder snaps and the uruks fall on top of each other STILL looks amazing because of the lighting choices, even though its a CGI sequence that's FIFTEEN years old, which in SFX years is an epoch.

The 'make a quick buck' mentality of studios means we're destined for a cycle of things looking fake but vivid for a couple of years and then as they're beat by better cgi just fake. The Hobbit is going to age sooo badly. It's such a shame.

 
- I thought many parts were pure CG... Like the T-Rex walking out of the padock at night, and the scene of chasing the gala.. galla... gallimimus.  

They just took the time to REALLY perfect the lighting. Which in various "How it's made" style interviews and specials they always said was a big deal.  
- Yeah, there's been some very good CGI. I can think of a lot of "wrong places" as well, though; namely Superman's upper lip.
- Those scenes stick with me as much as the T-Rex ones. When I had the Jurassic Park 'Build your own park' game as a kid, I think it was pretty telling that I made an entirely herbivorous park. I didn't care about the big, nasty t-rexes or little velociraptors. I just wanted a park full of friendly dinos to safari through.
- I always thought the story of Sphere was more mysterious than The Abyss. 
- That adaptation was one of my biggest Crichton movie letdowns 

I'd love to see some of the less successful adaptations rebooted instead of Jurassic park # 14
- Michael Beihn! Best known for playing Kyle Reese in the Terminator 
- But they were all blue and dead looking 
- Dude read the book, it's amazing.
- You can kind of think of it as one big psychological experiment. Put a group of humans in a room and give them the power to create whatever they can imagine. How would it end up?
- Crichton was always so good at laying the foundation, in that way.
- Shut up! You filthy...
- Amy. Good. Gorilla!
- he owes everybody money everywhere he goes.
- is this the movie where everyone gets offed by some ridiculous laser?
- Did you just give that gorilla a martini?
- "liar, liar, pants on fire." Love it.
- #WHO IS KAFKA?!
- Mitchell! Eye on the diamond!
- BRRAZIL 
- I miss [seeing] Delroy Lindo [in major motion pictures]
- YES!
- Hold on to your butts!
- I get goosebumps when the melodica starts playing. Every time.
- [Yes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk)


- Must have seen the movie at least 20 times, and I still get chills at that scene
- Pretty sure that's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.

You're looking for:

*DUR NUR NURRRRRRRRRRRR nurrr nurrr*

*DUR NUR NURRRRRRRRRRRR nurrr nurrr*

*DUR NUR NURRRRRRRRRRRR nurrr nurrr nuuuurrrrrrrrrrrr*



Edit: oh wait I know which bit you mean now. I concur with your *Dun Dun Daa Daas*
- The best parts of them to me, is when they just are a character being a character and not (as of lately) blindly obviously trying to be the whole "look at me, I'm a strong FEMALE protagonist." Ripley and Sarah were just well written and compelling protagonists that happen to be female.
- This part is my favorite by far! I wish it was in the movie. 

Run program (numbers match) "see look it's fine"
Then they run it to not cap off at the expected number (what a bunch of dopes) and they see they are so many more than there should be.

Queue....it was at this moment they knew....they fucked up.
- One of my favorite parts of the book was the graphs and statistical models that Crichton threw in. It made it seem like all of this was real and all the genetic science had actually taken place at some point 
- He hides in a construction pipe and blasts one raptor in the face, only surviving the second raptor because he got far enough into the tube they can't bite his feet
- Also in the book the Asian genetic scientist (Dr Wu?) gets eaten alive and gutted by the raptors during the raptors siege of the hotel everyone is holed up in. In the movie he just gets on that last boat out and leaves 
- That's pretty hardcore but I have to question his choice of appropriate weapon for dinosaur. 
- Been a long time but I'm pretty sure the lawyer lives, along with the game warden.  Hammond & the geneticist die in fairly gruesome ways.  

Edit: for clarity, those are the differences.  Grant/kids/Nedry/etc have the same ultimate fate in both.
- Gennaro survives after decking a raptor in the *snout but dies between the book and The Lost World to dysentery in Mexico.

What the hell, Crichton.

Edit: Fuck Autocorrect.
- The lawyer, Gennaro, is a badass in the book. He's described as sort of a gym enthusiast and goes out of his way to protect people a number of times. Notable scenes involve him fighting off a raptor while unarmed and joining a drunk Muldoon on a high speed T-Rex chase while armed with a rocket launcher.
- He dies years later from dysentery I shit you not. 
- The lawyer in the movie is actually a combination of two characters from book if I remember correctly.
Edit: a word
- It's crazy how different the movie and book are. Aside from a few core characters, almost everybody who lives in the movie dies in the book, and vice versa.
- Gennaro (yes, that's the lawyer's name) was a pretty cool character in the book and was nothing like what was portrayed in the movies. 

First of all, he's was a muscular dude. Let that sink in
- He's a god damn badass who works with Muldon to fight raptors WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER. the book is so good. Audible's version is great minus a few faults.
- _insert Palpatine here_

Ironic.
- Spoiler alert: Yes.
- In the book,  there is much more detail on the dinos. Compys are mostly scavengers, but they also have a very mild toxin they inject when biting prey. This makes the prey tired and weak,  and so they can overcome larger prey in numbers by biting things and darting away,  waiting for it to tire itself out. 
- Oh no, Nedry still gets disemboweled like a motherfucker
- seriously, how lex didn't get the shit slapped out of her is beyond me. stupid kid doing something to risk everyone's life? fucking SLAP.
- Around 1/2 through the book by Michael Crichton is a scene where Nedry gets devoured. It is incredibly graphic, and is exactly what I would have expected from a hard "R" Jurassic Park
- For starters, B.D. Wong probably would've been disemboweled like he was in the book. Plus, on a production level, I can see early 90's Cameron making something on par with the Spielberg version. 
- Me too.. At the same time I really appreciate Spielberg's version that I can show to my 8 year old with minimal "oh shit don't watch this part!" moments.
- If I had 'fuck you in the billions'. kind of money I'd love to grab like 5 top of the line directors, Speilberg, Cameron, Nolan, Guillermo and Peter Jackson for example and give them the same Blockbuster script, 250 million each and 2 years to each make their own movie of that script and see the results and compare the differences.

Would be amazing to see and film students would be studying the results forever.
- Imagine if instead of doing this new Jurassic world stuff they did a hard R remake of Jurassic Park with an appropriate great director?

I loved Jurassic world when I saw it but the more I think about it the more problems I have. Plus the trailers for the sequel look awful haha
- James "Nasty Girl" Cameron
- [Send in the marines!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blcJbSRxf0s)
- I think Aliens were less scary for me when I watched it, because I had had an Aliens toy, when I was younger. So they were "The Aliens" rather than these unknowable super monsters they were supposed to be.
- James Cameron’s version would not have been the definitive dinosaur movie. 

Spielberg’s was. 
- It really wasn't for kids at all. Really violent, scary, and gory. I'm still amazed at how many kids saw it, but then again, enough kids saw Robocop to warrant a cartoon series based on it.
- What about Athletic Girl kicking a raptor in the face?

That scene always has me laughing
- Raptors in the grass always gives me the chills to watch, very well done
- No strings attached and friends with benefits?
- It did literally bring about a whole boom of 3D. To say it had no impact because people don't quote it does everything beyond the dialogue a huge disservice.
- The problem with Avatar is that it's story was very generic and boring. The only reason the movie was successful was because of the groundbreaking special effects and 3D. So it's really more of a technical marvel then an entertainment marvel.
- deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2554  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/85107)
- Speak for yourself. I have not forgotten the best 3D experience in a theater. :).  Almost bested by Gravity... Just by a hair. 
- Out here raising the bar 
- The Hobbit aging badly won't be a problem because nobody will bother watching it again to notice.
- Yeah, certain parts are pure CGI, many others used CGI to incorporate practical effects more believably, they chose which very carefully. You’re right about the lighting, to; the rain, for instance, was deliberately chosen to cover the CGI. It bothers me when people say Jurassic Park was good because they stuck to practical effects, because Jurassic Park is a perfectly example of how CGI *should* be done.
- Sphere is truly one of the best pieces of sci-fi. A masterpiece of a book.
- And Corporal Hicks in Aliens.

- That's a different part of the theme than what I was trying to emulate, but good job on putting that into text. I was going for the helicopter approach when they see the island for the first time.

Also, I definitely recommend listening to the full 7-minute piece on YouTube or wherever. It's beautiful.
- The theme of motherhood is central in both movies. Sarah Connor transforms into a badass when she finds out she’s going to have a son that needs to learn how to fight to save humanity. In the extended version of Aliens, Ellen Ripley is a mother that learns that her daughter died while she was in hypersleep, and adopts Newt as a protector. The climax of Aliens is a battle between two queen mothers, both seeking revenge for their lost children. 
- The fractal that is between chapters really kicked me towards science.

Where the "faults in the system become evident" line is below the sixth iteration I believe, of the dragon curve, kid me got goosebumps.

From one sentence and a partial fractal.

I put them all on my wall. I miss them.
- He went out there knowing they were there hunting someone else. I don't blame him for actually surviving.
- Grenade launchers are most effective against unprotected flesh and require less aiming than a conventional firearm.

So I guess yeah, they'd be pretty damn great at killing dinosaurs. And probably more reliable than trying to put a bullet in one.
- Hammond didn't want any weapons on the island. Muldoon had a locker with a rocket launcher and tranquilizers though.

And in the book, Nedry takes the jeep that Muldoon had put the rocket launcher into, causing him to have to track down how far Nedry got to find the jeep with the rockets in it
- Well, I definitely have to read this book now.

Edit: definitely
- Nedry gets disemboweled.
- And then the military bomb the entire island.
- They had to make the book more in line with the movie for The Lost World, hence Malcom coming back to life in the book. 
- How in the world did he die of dysentery on a business trip? I don't care if it's in Mexico. Did he hike 5 miles into the desert to meet a client? 


- Wasn't his character way more likable in the book? I read it last like 15 years ago, but I remember thinking he was basically another generally good guy main character alongside Grant.


- He must have been a fan of playing Oregon Trail.
- This is the movie I want. 
- And then they tell at him and treat him like a bitch when he doesn't want to go into the raptor nest. Like fuck you guys. I would like to point out, it's not as though they're firing the rocket launcher when the Rex is chasing them, they simply sedate it and it later falls asleep and bites it's own tongue, lol.
- He shit, I not.
- Yeah, he takes on all of the bad parts of Hammond. In the novel things are pretty much under control until Hammond starts manipulating people.

Ie. sure the storm happens and the fences go down but things are pretty contained. Grant is basically having his dream hiking vacation with the kids while the rest are safely in the bunker.

But when Hammond realises that the lysene contingency plan is going to kill all of his expensive dinosaur and set the park back years, he starts crying "oh, why won't anyone think of the children, we have to get the park back up and running". He basically manipulates people into leaving the bunker and rebooting the system.

And that leads to the raptors getting out and the real death and destruction starts.

Novel Hammond is a greedy son of a bitch that intentionally puts people in harms way to try and save his park. Movie Hammond is just disastrously naive. And they made him that way by shunting all his negative character traits to the lawyer.
- Seriously? [What the fuck does he want this time?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
- "The dinosaur stared at him and then snapped its head in a single swift motion. Nedry felt something smack wetly against his chest. He looked down and saw a dripping glob of foam on his rain-soaked shirt. He touched it curiously, not comprehending. . . . It was spit. The dinosaur had spit on him.

It was creepy, he thought. He looked back at the dinosaur and saw the head snap again, and immediately felt another wet smack against his neck, just above the shirt collar. He wiped it away with his hand.

Jesus, it was disgusting. But the skin of his neck was already starting to tingle and burn. And his hand was tingling, too. It was almost like he had been touched with acid.

Nedry opened the car door, glancing back at the dinosaur to make sure it wasn't going to attack, and felt a sudden, excruciating pain in his eyes, stabbing like spikes into the back of his skull, and he squeezed his eyes shut and gasped with the intensity of it and threw up his hands to cover his eyes and felt the slippery foam trickling down both sides of his nose. Spit. The dinosaur had spit in his eyes.

Even as he realized it, the pain overwhelmed him, and he dropped to his knees, disoriented, wheezing. He collapsed onto his side, his cheek pressed to the wet ground, his breath coming in thin whistles through the constant, ever-screaming pain that caused flashing spots of light to appear behind his tightly shut eyelids.

The earth shook beneath him and Nedry knew the dinosaur was moving, he could hear its soft hooting cry, and despite the pain he forced his eyes open and still he saw nothing but flashing spots against black. Slowly the realization came to him. He was blind.

The hooting was louder as Nedry scrambled to his feet and staggered back against the side panel of the car, as a wave of nausea and dizziness swept over him. The dinosaur was close now, he could feel it coming close, he was dimly aware of its snorting breath.

But he couldn't see. He couldn't see anything, and his terror was extreme. He stretched out his hands, waving them wildly in the air to ward off the attack he knew was coming.

And then there was a new, searing pain, like a fiery knife in his belly, and Nedry stumbled, reaching blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery mass that was surprisingly warm, and with horror he suddenly knew he was holding his own intestines in his hands. The dinosaur had torn him open. His guts had fallen out.

Nedry fell to the ground and landed on something scaly and cold, it was the animal's foot, and then there was new pain on both sides of his head. The pain grew worse, and as he was lifted to his feet he knew the dinosaur had his head in its jaws, and the horror of that realization was followed by a final wish, that it would all be ended soon"
- I remember being in awe of that scene when I read the book back in sixth grade. All of us little boys were thrilled that a book could talk about someone holding their own warm intestines in their hands. 
- I wrote a book report in the fourth grade about Crichton's Jurassic Park that ended up encouraging my fifth grade peer reviewer to read the book. Our teacher received phone calls from that student's parents because of the nightmares that scene gave her. 
- Oh yeah, I've read the novel many times (as well as all of Crichton's other books, RIP). Adapting all the true horror elements from the novel into an R-rated film would have been amazing.

Of course, that will never happen now. But no one has the rights to "dinosaur films" so it makes me wonder, with the success of the JP series, why no other studio attempts to make a dinosaur movie. 
- It's been a while since I read it, but doesn't Hammond get eaten in the end as well? 
- I imagine that the feeling of James Cameron's JP would have been closer to the opening scene of JP, along with the Ellie creeping through the Compound to find the breakers with the Raptors, and the scenes with the mercenaries in the long grass in JP:LW. Those were very dark, Aliens like and would have probably been what the entire movie would be like.
- Chittering became one of my favorite words after reading that book. 
- Yeah, but that wouldn't have made $1.6b+
- its easy to call it definitive when we grow up with spielberg's version. maybe if it was cameron's, the definitive would be scary, vicious, majestic creatures instead of large, wonderful, majestic creatures. what i'm trying to say is different directors' vision can define a concept very differently, regardless whether the definition is true or not. 
- I think it would, but only because "dinosaur movie" isn't really a genre. Like, are there any dinosaur movies at all except for the Jurassic Park franchise? 

If Cameron had made it that would still be the only dinosaur movie most of us would be able to name.
- Jeff Goldblum's daughter who I guess is someone else's biological daughter but he got custody after the divorce?
- The Illusionist and The Prestige.
- FERNGULY IN SPACE MOTHERFUCKER

The movie was a visual treat but the relatability was nil.

Am I blue? No. A giant cat thing? No, they have sex weird. Am I in a space war? No, but I'd kick ass. Did I Learn anything? Only if we count wanting to try weird blue space cat sex. 
- That's because it's dances with wolves... In space
- [removed]
- So why wouldn't you want Cameron to do another amazing 3-D movie that has nothing to do with Avatar? If the technical aspects is what got you?
- > Jurassic Park is a perfectly example of how CGI should be done  

THIS has always been my point about CGI. I mean the only thing that REALLY sticks out for me watching JP now, on a 55" screen is that you can see the "jaggies" in the CG at that resolution and scale.  

Even watching the Galli's jump on the log looks really good to this day.  

And yet in this day an age even Star Wars The LAst Jedit could not make 2/3rds of their CGI come close to looking real... Like some of it looks like "Deleted Scene" CGI. Like the floating rocks scene!
- [deleted]
- Sounds like I just found my next read.
- Goddamn right.
- Hicks!  One of my favorite characters of all time.
- I understand that reading is scary, but there's an audiobook.
- CAPTAHN PULEASE.
- I laugh every goddamn time. 
- Get away from her you BITCH!
- I mean who hides in a tube, the dude has balls
- Oh I agree with an RPG for any of the dinosaurs, but choosing a tranquilizer gun for the t-rex, then needing to go after raptors before pulling the grenade launcher out seems a bit misaligned. I'm thinking t-rex? Biggest gun we have, pronto. 
- [removed]
- Jurassic Park is one of my favorite novels.  So much is left out of the movie its almost like 2/3rds of the book is missing.  I could list lots of stuff but spoilers. 

The worst part (to me) is there's an entire subplot missing from the movie that is then tangentially referenced in the second movie,  but is still not really discussed.

I still love the movies but the books are just more complete,  and are better stories. 
- The book is amazing. The author is one of the best sci-fi writers who ever lived, imo, I've read nearly all his books and they are all fantastic. 
- The book The Lost World barely has anything to do with the movie. I hated that movie.
- To be fair, Crichton never explicitly says Malcolm dies, hence why he was allowed to bring him back without heavily ret-conning things *too* hard
- Maybe. He's in a Mexican mine at the beginning of the movie.
- Crichton was just trying to sync his sequel book with the film version of his first book a bit, and it's a bit of a nod to his toilet death in the film. 
- Yeah book Gennaro was pretty cool and really looked out for the kids.
- While yes that is book Hammond, movie Gennaro is more in line with Ed Regis who runs away and gets killed by the T-Rex. 
- I'd say he takes Ed Regis' spot more than novel Hammond. I don't think there is a novel Hammond in the film, to be honest. 
- That was an intense, captivating read. To be honest, I kind of feel a bit queasy after reading that. I'm hooked though, I need to read this book. 

Edit: SPG.
Edit pt. 2: Reading everyone's comments about this book has hyped me so much! I've just bought it off Amazon, I cannot wait to get stuck in. 
- Yea, that!! Man...middle school me thought that was way worse. Still, it'd be like that. 
- I was wracking my brain to remember the scene until your last line here ha ha and then it all came back
- I remember exactly reading that for the first time, back in fifth grade. It was then that it dawned on me that a book could be 'violent' like a movie could. I was a big Crichton fan ever since.

Fast forward to today, and I just finished 'Pirate Latitudes' this morning.
- IIRC, that was the description for everyone who died via raptor/dilo, some thing something, intestines like warm spaghet, piling on the floor, and thems all dead
- Oh man that's sucks haha
- What if the guys behind Resident Evil did Dino Crisis
- [deleted]
- Yes, he does. Pretty sure compys get him like the Spanish guy with headphones in The Lost World movie.
- If I remember correctly, he got eaten alive by a flock of compys (procompsognathus) while he was hobbling around with a broken leg.
- Yea, he had the death that the Russian guy in Lost World had with the little green dinos....I think 
- [deleted]
- Bee Movie and Wicker Man (2006).
- > the relatability was nil.

I thought the idea that the tree/plant system was interlinked in a similar fashion to human neurons was quite interesting, and I thought they were gonna go down a literal, living Gaia type situation, but nothing really came of that bit :(

There was some interesting potential for the viewer to have sympathy for the planet itself, and not simply the creatures living on the planet, but yeah, I didn't really see them take it anywhere.
- The Lion Kong is just Hamlet with animals, are you trying to tell me The Lion King isn’t a good movie?
- I always saw it as Pocahontas in space.
- Except for the scene when they’re on their first outing in the park and see all the iguanadons and long neck boys, that did not hold up well at all, but it’s probably because of the hd TVs we have now. I bet it still looks pretty sick on vhs and crt.
- I inhale Crichton's books.  

Sphere is especially fantastic.
- Do ittt
- As an engineer, I really enjoyed Airframe. Hadn't heard anyone mention it
- You won't be able to put it down.  It's that good.

Well, hopefully I haven't hyped it up too much, enjoy!
- Stay frosty
- I guess she don't like the cornbread either.
- Clever warden.
- Hammond didn't want him to kill the T-rex because of its cost. At that point in the novel the shit that hit the fan hadn't hit a second fan yet.
- There's a turning point in the novel. When Nedry shuts down the fences, a lot of dinosaurs get out but the raptors are still locked up.

Since they can track all the dinosaur's general locations, it's pretty clear that the situation is tenable. Grant is guiding the kids through the park and the rest of the people are in the bunker.

As a precaution, Muldoon wants to put the rex down but since there's no immediate danger, Hammond convinces him to just tranq it.

Later on Hammond (who is considerably less friendly in the novel) Hammond worries about the lysene contingency plan. Essentially the dinosaurs slip into a coma and die if not medicated daily. He manipulates the people in the bunker to go out and reset the park (incidentally freeing the raptors in the process) by crying about the children being all alone out there.

When Muldoon realises the raptors are free and hunting people, he basically says fuck it and grabs the grenade launcher. No more trying to save Hammond's expensive investments.
- Besides what the other people are saying, a Rex is actually manageable in a "realistic" sense with a powerful tranq. It's not gonna sneak up on you, it's a huge target, it can't reach you in tight spaces, it's fairly stupid, etc.

Raptors are really damn fast, roughly human-size, smart as hell, stealthy as fuck, etc. They are so, so much worse.
- [deleted]
- Isn't that when the kids who had befriended a baby raptor threw it at the adult raptor to get away? Baby imprinted on them in egg hatching scene. 

That was so messed up to me. I mean logical,  but all kinds of messed up. 
- Doesn't Dr. Wu shoot some of the raptors with a rocket launcher?
- Jesus Christ. I want to see this version of Jurassic Park.
- [deleted]
- Wu's death was he most shocking to me of all of them.  He is opens the door to try and let Ellie into the lodge and a raptor jumps down and slices him open.  She closes the door as she see's him trying to push the raptor head away as its eating his intestines.
- > The geneticist is fucking eaten alive by raptors. He tries to beat them away as they yank his intestines out of his body.

I read the book as a kid over 20 years ago and I still remember that part vividly.
- "They did not even permit the burial of Hammond or Ian Malcolm.  They simply waited.”
He died. It was only changed because he was such a popular character in the movie that he had to write him back in. 
[proof](https://m.imgur.com/UiNYeMS) 
- In the way he died perhaps. Movie Genarro is the one with all the exploitative ideas. He came in looking for a safety report to reassure investors. He stopped caring by the time lunch was served.
- The book is phenomenal. One of the best pieces of science fiction I’ve ever read. When I read it a few years ago I had already watched the movie a hundred times as a kid so I knew what it was all about. Reading the book as an adult I wished I could’ve had my memory erased so I could experience it as if I had seen the book on the shelf, read the title for the first time and just started reading. I seem to remember it’s also a fairly easy read and not very long at all so I would say it would be well worth your time to read :)
- You're in for a treat. The book is so so so so good. 
- The intro bit with the injured worker is so incredible. The only thing I wish would have been different about the movie was keeping faithful to the intro. It’s the perfect way to frame the shady things and questionable ethics happening at a weird remote resort project without showing anything. It’s a really gruesome intro but the way it sets up what’s going on is masterful. 
- It's a great read. Top notch Crichton.
- I need to reread all of Crichten work again. Read them all as a teen but  I think I'd enjoy them even more now. To the ebooks!
- [deleted]
- How was Pirate Latitudes? It's been collecting dust on my shelf since I picked it up, this thread may have motivated me to dust it off.
- Sam Neil describes that very scene to a kid in the beginning of the movie, how the raptors would slice open your belly. 
- Read that as dying by raptor dildo which would definitely suck. 
- I'm sure there are exceptions but the book does seem like a bit much for 8-9 year olds.
- I'm pretty surprised there hasn't been a Turok movie with Dwayne Johnson as the lead. Turock, if you will. 
- Malcolm actually dies in the book, too, but The Lost World basically ass-pulls a "oh he wasn't dead, he just really really looked like it."

...even though in the original book, they have a *goddamn funeral* for him.
- Don't forget, it wasn't actually a T Rex, it was his grandkids playing T Rex sounds over a loudspeaker. So technically it's their fault their grandpa died. Heavy...
- Not to be pedantic, but the Spanish guy with headphones (Carter) actually gets crushed by the T rex when they're all running away. Dieter (sp?) is the guy who is played by Peter Stormare who gets killed by the compys. 
- [deleted]
- That makes sense. 

Sounds like I need to read it again - last time I read it was right after it was released (before the movie). I remember thinking it was an amazing book and it got me hooked on Crichton. It's been years since I've read any of his stuff; might be time to get back into it. 
- Tbh when you gotta go, you gotta go.
- Yeah! They thought the raptors would be concerned about the baby but instead two of the fuckers tear it in half.
- [deleted]
- Muldoon blows one raptors leg off. Then other raptors eat it. 
- [removed]
- Its actually pretty easy to not die from it. Electrolytes and water or a decent iv will tode you over. The problem happens when you have no access to clean water or adequate electrolytes. Rice water is a good substitute. As in the water left over from cooking rice.
- [deleted]
- Oh man, I read that book like 20 years ago. After reading that passage, I very much want to read it again. 
- It is good but I feel like Jurassic Park and Lost World kind of eclipse Crichtons other books which are also really good as well but usually get overlooked. Congo, Eaters of The Dead, Sphere, The Andromeda Strain, and The Great Train Robbery are all good reads too. 
- [deleted]
- The *only* issue I had with this book is the scene where they try to sneak past the sleeping T-Rex and the little girl can't help but sneeze. Cliche doesn't even begin to describe that, really glad that scene didn't work its way into the screenplay. 
- This is probably an entirely personal feeling, so I don't state it as if to imply I think the film should've been this way for the betterment of it to everyone watching.

That said though, I actually love the concept of the Jurassic Park movie completely omitting the first scene with the raptor, because when you do... and if you assume the person watching somehow doesn't know what this movie is about, then you have this incredible buildup to the reveal of - holy fuck - a living dinosaur. You get hints and bits, and it makes you *wonder* if that will maybe be what is going on... but you don't get the awe of the realization sinking in until the characters do with you.

I personally find that scenario of going into the film blind and being led up to that moment as being super cool, and the intro scene completely makes that impossible because, obviously, we see there's a living breathing dino/monster right out the gate. It also immediately portrays these creatures as dangerous, rather than letting the movie slowly build up to the "will things go wrong / how will things go wrong?" that it could without that scene.

In the end it may not make a better movie to do it that way, but it's personally how I think I'd prefer it be done/handled.
- Oh my I just remembered the whole bit about the locals having babies eaten or taken away by the “wildlife” in the middle of the night. That was some gruesome stuff
- My dad took me to see the movie in theatres. I was a dinosaur obsessed 7-year old. He'd already seen the movie to screen it and make sure I'd be okay. I loved 99% of the movie, but that opening scene gave me nightmares
- [deleted]
- I believe when the book was written Deinonychus were considered to be Velociraptors and not their own distinct species yet, so the raptors in the book were correct based on that false assumption. And the movie was just using the name given by the book, even if it had been proven wrong by that point.
- It was a the same in the book because he still got spit in the face.
- I think, in the late 80s when the book was written, there was some debate about velociraptor. It was more a general name for that type of dinosaur, and later it was decided that "velociraptor" specifically was a small species. 

Or something like that. 
- And Utahraptor was unknown when the movie was made; if you're inclined to it, you could make something spooky a nd mysterious out of that.
- No velociraptors were not chicken sized.  They were four to six foot long and 3 feet high depending on the species
- I loved it. I've been on a huge pirate history kick lately, listening to podcasts, reading, etc. I saw that book used, thought 'what the hell' and picked it up for a couple bucks. Read it within two days, couldn't put it down. The thing I liked most about it is that (while it's a work of fiction) it's very realistic. Crichton has always researched the living shit out of anything he's writing about, probably more than any other author I can think of, and I've always admired him for that. He really nails all the little details of Port Royal in the 1660's (just before Henry Morgan goes on his 22 month raid IRL) as well as the political climate in Europe that sets up the story. It was very cool to read a pirate adventure story set up with so much attention to historical detail, as opposed to something like Pirates of the Caribbean, which is set in some random time well after the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring characters that were all dead by that point (like Blackbeard).

Anyway, dust it off and give it a read, it's a fun time.
- 7/10
- Fuck. Yes. I just want to see that cerebral bore in live action.
- This actually made me laugh out loud. And I would actually watch that.
- I'd watch that any day of the week. 
- Jason Momoa dude.
- Yeah, but Hammond is more of a dick in the book so you don't feel as bad.  Definitely not the Sir Richard version of the character.

Post Title: 'Jurassic Park,' 'The Shining,' 'Brokeback Mountain', and 'Rebecca' Enter the National Film Registry, Deeming them Culturally, Historically or Aesthetically Significant
Author: BunyipPouch
Score: 42821

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- That 10-minute T-Rex attack scene, I still marvel at it. The editing, the pace, the ridiculous powers of suspense that Spielberg plays with - and how unbelievably real that dinosaur looked. When it roars at Grant, looking up from the bottom of the other jeep, with tire in its teeth, it's one of my favorite shots in movies. Glad the film registry puts the great popcorn movies in there too

EDIT: It's a Ford T-RExplorer. Also thank you for the Silver! Spared no expense 
- > The inductees include Hitchcock's first American feature, Rebecca (1949); the noir classics Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Welles' The Lady From Shanghai (1947); Spielberg's groundbreaking dinosaur tale Jurassic Park (1993); Edwards' bitter commentary about alcoholism, Days of Wine and Roses (1962); Kubrick's chilling The Shining (1980); Buster Keaton's ingenious The Navigator (1924); Kasi Lemmons' eerie family drama, Eve's Bayou (1997); Smoke Signals (1998), the first feature to be written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans; and Lee's love story Brokeback Mountain (2005), which is now the most recent film on the Registry. 
> 
> The 30th annual selection of 25 films deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant to the nation's film heritage helps ensure that those on the list will be preserved for all time. 


- But what about Kangaroo Jack?
- Surprised it took them this long for The Shining.
- [deleted]
- My girlfriend and I watched The Shining a couple days ago and god damn is that a great movie. The subtle and gradual shift from being a corny looking and acted hallmark-esque movie ending with Jack’s maniacal “I’m not gonna hurt ya...” is just incredible directing and acting 
- Now I’ll I can imagine is heath ledger and jake Gyllenhaal in their little tent, then a raptor shows up. Clever girl. 
- I'm very surprised The Shining and Jurassic Park weren't on there yet... They've been established genre changers/makers, and classics, for a while now.
- Glad to see *The Shining* make it in.  I'm a big Stephen King fan, but interestingly enough Stephen King *hates* this adaptation.  Not only that but it received mediocre critical reviews when it was released.  It's legacy basically built organically over the years to where it is now.
- Wish I could get admitted for being aesthetically pleasing....
- God, I just watched Rebecca after the release of Phantom Thread. What an astounding film. It really makes me want to take a deeper dive into Hitchcock's other early work.
- But John, if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down the pirates don't eat the tourists.
 
- ...*googles "Rebecca movie"*
- Still surprised that none of the Lord of the Rings movies are in there. 
- I really feel like Brokeback Mountain marked a turning point for the gay community. It was the first movie about gay people that I can recall where they didn't come across as stereotyped or caricatures of themselves. I was so glad it existed, because I was more of an Ennis and it kind of opened me up to the pain waiting for me down the road, if I kept down that path.
- When is Home Alone gonna get the praise it deserves 
- When will The Room be added?
- Congrats to Rebecca, one of my favorite movies. Very underappreciated in Hitchcock's filmography
- I saw Jurassic Park in theaters again recently. It’s amazing how 25 year old effects hold up when they are done well. 
- Weird, Brokeback Mountain, but not Crash? Weird.   

&#x200B;

Huh, weird.  

&#x200B;

WEIRD.

&#x200B;

/s
- All classics. 

I saw Brokeback Mountain for the first time just a few months ago, and it blew me away. When it came out I was a snotty little high school freshman, laughing at all the “brokeback” jokes. I wondered why gay people were so loud. I wondered why they needed to be marching through the streets shoving their way of life into our faces. I thought it was hysterical that there was a movie about two gay cowboys. 

Now, fully grown and emotionally mature, I get it. 
- Rebecca is such a great movie.  Highly recommend if you haven't seen it.

Though the article is wrong.  Rebecca was done in 1940, not 1949.
- [removed]
- Shouldn't all of Kubrick's films be in the registry,really? Good stuff
- Rebecca is great
- Still love the scene when Heath holds Jake's bloodied shirt up to his face at the end, such a great film and just sad. 
- Jurassic Park is a perfect movie from start to finish. 
- When I started reading the title I was hoping to discover that they were all secretly part of a shared universe. 

Actual content disappoints
- Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece and easily one of the best films of it's respective decade. 
- As a gay man who loves dinosaurs, horror and fucking in tents the first 3 sure are iconic 
- Not Scorcher VI?
- Jurassic Park is TOP 1 fun entertainment movie of all times. (It was the first movie i saw in a movie theater, so i think i'm a little biased)
- Finally, "it's a UNIX system, I know this" gets the recognition it deserves.
- I have the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack in my
Spotify study playlist and I have been known to shed a single tear in the library because “He Was a Friend of Mine” comes on. That movie is just too much for me to emotionally bear. 
- But what about Shrek?
- And when Nic Cage's National Treasure?
- WTH is *Rebecca*?  hmmm, let's see:

> Rebecca is a 1940 American romantic psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It was Hitchcock's first American project [and] stars Laurence Olivier as the brooding, aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter and Joan Fontaine as the young woman who becomes his second wife. [It] won the 1940 Academy Award for Best Picture.

oh OK.  one those where the real mystery is, how come this didn't make it in many years ago
- BrokeBack Mountain losing best picture to Crash is one of the truest and most egregious errors the academy, and maybe just awards in general, have ever made. A true piece of art vs a schlocky “can’t we all just get along” cliche fest that was admittedly written in 3 days. It’s just wrong. 
- Everyone who hasn’t seen Rebecca, go watch it. Personally i think Hitchcock never topped it, such an amazing film.
- Damn straight, dinosaurs are fucking rad.
- Leave Her To Heaven doesn't get discussed as much but that film is absolutely spectacular. A color Noir film that is darker than most. Really superb performances with a killer story.
- Just the shot of Jeff Goldblum's bare chest in Jurassic Park deserves its own wing.
- Very happy about all these but the one no one is mentioning is Broadcast News! That's one of the best films of the 80s, very glad to see it get in this year.
- Also, "Broadcast News"
- What about Star Wars?
- Jack fucking Twist and the twisted Jack Torrance got on the list. 
- I haven't seen Brokeback Mountain yet,but the other three are very special and dear to my heart. Nice to see them recognized this way.
- You should all see Rebecca if you haven’t done so already.
- I misread "Jurassic Bark" and was amazed an episode of Futurama made it.  
- Kind of hard to believe that Groundhog Day got in before The Shining. 
- Registry doesn't mean shit until Surf Ninjas is in there.
- and yet Attack of the Clones remains left out smh 
- Not seen Brokeback but the other three are damn good films, if I may be so bold, sir
- For me it was the [Brachiosaurus reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg). The way the camera pans and the music kicks in and you share the amazement the characters are having on screen, like children watching the impossible. The first time I saw that I was honestly left speechless. And it only gets better from that point.
- The most effective directorial choice in that scene is the lack of a score - our only sounds are the rain, the snorting of the T-Rex, the heavy breathing that turns to screams...

Thank you for this post. I’ve always found it to be the film’s best scene.
- I had just read the book the year before the movie came out, and to this day it's the only film adaptation of a novel that I've ever watched without making mental comparisons while viewing. I was just too amazed. 
- God I love Jurassic Park. Most of the reviews at the time were lukewarm and a lot of the people I talk to about it seem to think it's not much more than a great popcorn movie but I think it's honestly one of the best and most important movies in cinema.

From the technological revolution that it helped to kick-start in the industry to the brilliant way it builds suspense to the fantastic acting. God, the music. Even the script is great at doing a lot with not much. The book has very little development for the characters but the script manages to work in believable arcs for lots of them, especially Hammond. I really think it's brilliant.

It's great to see it recognised in this way and to see people appreciating it like you. 
- I'm not ashamed to say thinking about how awesome the dinosaurs looked and how people must've felt watching it for the first time has made me tear up. Also, I was watching the director's cut bonus feature vhs tape. You should watch it if you haven't. 
- One of the only movies I read the book first I was so into it. I remember ending a friendship with my buddy Josh in grade school because he was adamant that Super Mario Brothers live action movie was gonna be the best movie while I thought it would be Jurassic Park. Suck it Josh.
- Obviously there's more, but [here's most of the scene.](https://youtu.be/HzZkNdn5hpA) It's got fantastic pacing. 
- [deleted]
- That is a great scene.  However, it's #2 in my book.  It is the first real "suspense" scene in the movie and it's so great, but not the best in the movie.

The raptors in the kitchen scene is the most suspenseful scene, I would argue, in all of cinema.  I was 10 years old watching that in the theater for the first time.  That's the scene that nearly gave me a heart attack.  I've seen the movie so many times and it is my favorite movie of all time.  I still get nervous watching that scene.  
- I don’t remember a trex in broke back mountain
- The pacing is what does it, it’s not cut in a way that feels montage-y or like you’re watching a movie. You were truly experiencing it first hand
- Are you me??? I’ve referenced that shot countless times when defending JP as my fav movie of all time. So so so good.
- Jurassic Park is more than a popcorn flick. 
- Yeah that shit with grant holding the flare still gives me the chills
- It's incredible how well the effects on thr T-Rex hold up even against the effects of today. The raptors, not so much.
- IAN, FREEZE!
- The suspense is JP is built in exactly the same way as Jaws.   


The former in a single scene, the latter an entire film.
- Everyone is aware that they remastered the original Jurassic Park in 3D frame by frame, and it is one of the best examples of 3D in the industry, right? RIGHT?
- The thing that helped the realstic Trex is that it was a giant animatronic robot. Made that much cooler and realistic.
- And the sound. Try watching it without the sound. Not the same at all.
- You just gave me goosebumps
- The T-Rex looks more real than most of today's CGI - probably because it was real.
- For the longest time, I had that exact shot of the t-rex roaring at Dr. Grant as the background on my desktop at work. Absolute masterclass of a scene.
- Yeah, Brokeback Mountain is great. 
- Jurassic Park is one of the scariest most suspenseful books I've ever read. It is one of the few book to movie adaptations that is actually excellent and really true to the book.
- That was my favorite part of Brokeback Mountain.
- It's surprising Rebecca wasn't in the National Film Registry earlier. 
- I thought Rebecca was 1940. Could be wrong but iirc it was very early in Hitchcock’s Hollywood career. Was there a rerelease or something?
- I need to rewatch Smoke Signals
- >Spielberg's groundbreaking dinosaur tale Jurassic Park (1993)

I feel like that's an overly simply description
- Maybe they should think about preserving more than just 750 movies...
- Oh man, Smoke Signals made the cut? I remember watching that in high school. Or rather, I remember exactly one scene of it from high school.

For those who have never before had the pleasure, I present to you: [John Wayne’s Teeth](https://youtu.be/xPnV2392Tck) 
- I think about this movie like once every year for some reason. This year, it was because of you.

Also I've never seen it.
- That’s already in of course. Along with the room. 
- What about Simple Jack?
- Not before "Freddy Got Fingered" gets inducted. 
- I put the money in the jacket...

And the jacket on the kangaroo...

AND NOW HE HOPPIN AWAY (sobs)
- I’m a knock you out Mama said knock you out
- What about Tropic Thunder??? 
- What about Boss Baby?
- And Rebecca. It won best picture in like 1940 or something.
- I'm starting to think that they hold some great older movies in a bucket waiting for those years when the list of significant films for archiving is a bit sparse.
- For sure. In my mind it was already broadly established as one of the most influential films, particularly in psychological horror. 
- It was always the best of them. The best god damn movie from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine... or Portland, Oregon for that matter.
- Am I the only one who didn’t really like this movie after reading the book? It’s sooo different from the novel.
- Is 2001: A Space Odyssey in yet? Because to me that is one of the most influential science fiction films ever. It even came out before we landed on the moon. Hell we should just go ahead and put all of Stanley Kubrick's films in there. 
- It's one of the most famous movies of all time. 

Classic scenes, amazing animatronics, great quotes, a legendary score, and underrated horror. Plus an underlying commentary on the risks of science and greed. 
- It was in many ways the highest point of the movie. Also inspired the beautiful ~~ocarina~~ melodica cover. 
- Its certainly culturally significant. Some consider it one of the best movies of all time. Not only is it a cinematic marvel with its excellent use of early CGI, but Jurassic Park has impacted and inspired billions of people around the world.

This movie has a well written script, gripping drama and excitement from beginning to end, great character development, and it appeals to the masses. 
- I’m just gonna bash your brains in!!
- That scene seriously makes that movie for me. I just watched it again with a friend who had never seen it before, and you should have seen his face when it shows his manuscript. Not only does it confirm that Jack has been insane for a long time, but it confirms it for the characters as well. You know Jack doesn't want Wendy to read it, and you know that he's going to be right behind her when she stops. The scene is super long and tense, the camera work is fantastic, and Jack Nicholson's performance is absolutely incredible.
- The raptor immediately gets all uncomfortable.

"Ahh! Ahh! I mean ... sorry. I'm not homophobic! I just ... it was just a surprise ... that's all! Honest! I teared up when the SCOTUS made their ruling! That reaction wasn't *me*!"
- Jack Nicholson axes through the tent and gives a "heeeerrreees Johnny!" I have no idea how to include Rebecca into this mashup as I've never heard of it.
- I'm sure that's probably on somebody's blog somewhere.
- I think visually Jurassic Park just gets better with age, because it becomes more and more remarkable that those special effects hold up and even look better than a lot of what comes out today. And, while I wasn't alive when it came out, wasn't The Shining pretty controversial for awhile after it released? 
- The Matrix should have been included. It influenced a lot how movies in America are made.
- Imagine it without Jack Nicholson.
- Mainly because the movie is actually a really bad adaption of his novel. In the novel Jack is seen as more of a tragic figure who gave into his drinking habits under the influence of the hotel, he was always portrayed as a good father at heart and had a moment of redemption at the end of the book. Wendy is also portrayed in a stronger light than the timid performance seen in the movie. The movie portrays Jack as someone who was always on the edge of insanity since the beginning, there were no real arcs the characters went through which is what I think King disliked about it. However as a Psychological Horror the movie is the best I have ever seen. It takes those supernatural elements from the book and just elevates them to outstanding heights. I like both the movie and the novel equally, but for different reasons.
- You can always fall back on banging a cowboy in the mountains
- I'd admit you :)
- Petition to change "**NSFW**" tags to "*Aesthetically Significant*".
- I'd recommend Spellbound, it stars Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman and features a dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali!
- The film is unusually true to the book- so you might enjoy reading it
- Watch the next one, Foreign Correspondent.
- I don't know, Depp likes to hang out there a lot these days .
- Watch it and also read the book, it’s probably my top three books.
- I was recommended the book a few months ago by a friend, and it was a great read! I was engrossed from the beginning and couldn't put it down. I can't wait to watch the movie.
- Great book and one of my favorite movies. Have the poster on my tv room wall. 
- There's still time. Fun fact, the first two Star Wars films are listed but are not archived on the library of Congress due to the fact that Lucas only offered special edition which were rejected.
- The Buster Keaton movie had to wait nearly a century.
- If you write to the organization and give them a good reason for including them, they will be considered. I wrote to them about a film, and it did get included the following year (not just because of me, I'm sure, but maybe I was the tipping point.)
- I'd like to give a shoutout to 20-year-old River Phoenix for giving a very heartbreaking, mature performance as a street hustler in 1991's My Own Private Idaho. 
- I remember when it came out and people complained about how it glorified the gay lifestyle, and in a little over decade, the gay lifestyle is steadily becoming common place in most populated places in the US.

It's funny that they thought it "glorified" the gay lifestyle, though, when you really consider the events of the movie. They spent the movie in fear of discovery and persecution, their affair has a detrimental effect on both of their lives, and it ends in tragedy. If you wanted, you could frame it as a cautionary tale.

What it does do, though, is normalize it, humanize it, and allow people to empathize with it, which was a big step for the time in mainstream movies. Broadway had long been ahead of the curb on this and some of it had attempted to bleed into Hollywood with Rent and Rocky Horror, but those never had the success to make waves and trigger the normalization.

Brokeback Mountain did, partly because Jack and Enis were just normal guys that fell in love. No pagentry, no pride, just love. As a bisexual who adores Broadway, I'll always love the flare and pride for alt lifestyles you'll find in theater, but sometimes the best way to get people to accept something is to portray it on their terms.

I feel like the difference in social response to Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Call Me By Your Name (2017) really illustrates how far we've come in so short a time. Gen Z and the younger Millennials might not appreciate just how quickly the social attitude toward homosexuality shifted.
- Best part was when cowboy groups pointed out in media releases that the two characters where sheep herders, not cowboys. You know it had to push some buttons elsewhere too
- Oh I agree. I was 16 in 2005 and I remember asking an older female classmate to buy tickets for us so I could see it. I remember sitting in the theater going through an emotional roller coaster. The pain portrayed on the screen felt so real to me. I was an emotional wreck after the movie ended lol. But it was the first time i saw two men who loved each other on the big screen. 
- [deleted]
- To me Brokeback Mountain is a movie about the torture and sadness of unrequited or more specifically unfulfilled love, something a lot of humans have experienced and why the movie, to me, just isn’t a “gay movie.” What makes it hit even harder is when they put it in the perspective of same sex love where the inability to experience, submit to and enjoy the love comes from societal constraints. I think it shows how powerful love is and the devastation love can cause if you don’t accept it and allow it. 
- I'm still salty that Brokeback Mountain got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but ended up losing to Crash. I mean, Crash was a fine film in its own right, but it didn't have the same cultural impact as Brokeback 
- You should see a lot of the great films from the queer cinema movement of the 90s, stuff like My Own Private Idaho or The Watermelon Woman. It wasn't the first gay film that was done serious and well.

What it was was the first gay film to be a real cultural moment. It made a lot of money for a story about gay men and of course all the Oscar attention and the infamous loss to Crash.

It was also the last time I remember just rampant open homophobia about a film. I feel like it was the last time you could openly mock a gay film for just existing. You don't see that with stuff like Call Me By Your Name. 

Also it definitely helped stop the stupid idea in Hollywood that if you play gay that it dooms your career. Jake has had an amazing career since and almost certainly Heath would have as well especially post TDK. 

So yeah I wouldn't say the first great gay film but one of the first mainstream ones which is where the culturally significant part comes in. It was absolutely a turning point for great queer representation on screen. 
- I remember when it came out everyone was joking about the "gay cowboy movie" like it was hilarious. Then I actually saw it and it was tragic, moving, and beautiful. The conversation around that movie sucked, but it definitely was a turning point for gay films. 
- I saw Brokeback Mountain while it was in limited release in a packed Greenwich Village theater. One of the best movie going experiences I've had, everyone was completely tuned in.  
- It was a really good movie, the stigma around it is still there, people still go "ew you watched that lul"... yes Karen I enjoy quality movies goddammit
- My very queer film professor hates the film. He essentially said that it presents gays as relatable to the rest of the heternormative community through pity or sympathy towards gayness. The message he said it sent was:

"Ledger and Gyllenhal are perfectly normal people except for one thing: they're gay...and that's a tragedy. The movie is tragic, we pity their gayness because without it, they would be just like us."

I guess it was a big moment in film but I can see why he disagrees that it was a big moment for the LGBT community. Just a thought

Edit: I just thought I would share my professor's view...I haven't even seen the movie but I always heard it heralded as "THE gay movie" so when he gave that lecture I was surprised.
- It’s crazy to think that this was only in 2005. It’s only been 13 years since the first real honest and mainstream movie about gay men (at least that I can recall). 
- I thought it was a western, they told me it was a western. Now, I'm sitting in the back and I'm watching it and I'm like 'wheres the guy? i wanna see a guy with a white hat and a black hat and i want to see them shooting each other up in front of the saloon', you know? Last thing i want to see is a close up of a beautiful hot cock slipping into an asshole. Now, they didn't show that in the movie... But why not?! If they're gonna make a movie, make it right. 
- Definitely no where near the first, but a pretty big deal to the mainstream audience since it wasn’t marketed as a gay movie. Doing that made more people see it. 
- Not even because it’s a good movie, but as far as cultural significance, Home Alone is pretty far up there.
- Shortly after *Maniac Cop*
- Tbf it is culturally significant. It’s the most well known bad/good movie. 
- Fuck it, I'll make an argument for this. It should be added because it popularized the "So Bad Good." Genre. Yes their were bad movies before it. I'm not even saying it invented the SBIG genre. But, it allowed people to get why these movies could be enjoyable experiences.  There were no bad movie nights or Rocky Horror like screenings of bad movies before this came out. This movie gave way to countless hours of YouTube and Podcasts about getting together with your friends and laughing at how ridiculous movies can actually be. This movie started a movement and a new appreciation  for classic bad films like Plan 9 and Troll 2.  Hell even some of the films on this list belong here for the soul fact that they marked a cultural turning point in cinema history. Why not The Room?
- Didn't it literally win Best Picture.

But yeah I hear you. When people say Hitchcock you think Psycho, Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest etc.
- Oddly coincidental but after putting it off for years I finally downloaded and watched this movie 2 days ago... really good movie.
- I've never seen the movie, but the book is great. Daphne du Maurier also wrote the short story "The Birds."
- The cardigan the protagonist wears was so popular in Spain that a wool jacket with buttons is now called a  'rebeca'
- It's my all-time favorite film. I never expected to see it mentioned on Reddit. 
- I took a Hitchcock class in college for film credits and Rebecca ended up being one of my surprise favorite films of the entire course. Really good movie. 
- I am not gay but I also enjoy those things.
- >BrokeBack Mountain losing best picture to Crash is one of the truest and most egregious errors the academy, and maybe just awards in general, have ever made.


They disqualified the original tron from the special effects category cause they considered using computers to be cheating. 
- They tried, but Lucas sent the Special Editions, and Congress sent them back
- It's really good. It's also a really good representation of Ang Lee's style - emotions bubbling just beneath the surface but hardly ever articulated amidst gorgeous landscape shots. I like his Sense and Sensibility for the same reason.
- You should take a chance and watch brokeback. Beautifully shot if nothing else.
- Up until this point, I think films always portrayed dinosaurs to be vicious. Thus, I expected the score to be some monstrous melody. But I love this scene because Williams does the exact opposite: he starts with a slow cello solo and gives the dinosaurs a romantic theme. It's beautiful!
- Get goosebumps just thinking about the way Sam Neil takes off his sunglasses and turns Laura Dern’s head so she can see too. They sold
The SHIT out of that reaction.
- I saw this movie about 15-18 times when it was in theaters.  It was the first movie I truly just LOVED.  

It probably was the catalyst for my love of movies.  
- Dude, that scene is master class.  I love that the characters see it before we do, and we see their reactions before we see the dinosaur as well.  It tells you just how momentous this is.  And then you see it, and it *really is* that amazing.  When the movie first came out, nobody had seen anything like that before.  We in the audience were witnessing something special too.  It’s amazing that, after four sequels of CGI dinosaurs doing all sorts of silliness, that scene still hasn’t lost that impact.  
- [removed]
- Sam Neil's reaction was perfect
- still the greatest movie music ever for me.
- The magic of John Williams.
- If I could chose any scene in cinematic history to go back to and watch for the first time in a cinema, it would be this one. I was only 3 at the time it came out, so I missed it. It would be like seeing dinosaurs for the first time... And then John Williams on top of that! Actually the scene is like 50% John Williams, 40% fucking dinosaurs and 10% Jeff Goldblum looking quite silly. It's a masterpiece.
- [I prefer this version of that scene.](https://youtu.be/zsMpFb1CNRI)
- I loved how they played on this part in Fallen Kingdom with the opposite emotion. How we as an audience connected with this helpless animal in despair.
- This scene still has me in awe.. 
- I was a preteen when I saw it, 15 years after it came out. I'm kinda bummed I wasn't able to appreciate what an achievement that movie was. I am glad, however, that I was at the perfect age to be utterly terrified of the T-Rex
- I love how both of them do the same thing - stand up and take their shades off.  Because the sunglasses are possibly playing with their eyes. 
- it's a bit sad that because of the way children grow up (being "used" to gigantic special effects), there probably isn't going to be anything like it again.

(and "Jurassic World" even commented on that, seeing dinosaurs in itself isn't that "special" anymore)

- This is one of my favorite scenes of all time. As other posters mentioned, it's the way the score fits into the scene that really makes it amazing. 
- Jurassic Park is my all time favourite move and this part right here always gets me. I recently checked out the new Jurassic World, and a piece of me felt the Brachiosaurus from the dock was this same Brachiosaurus and that makes me sad. 
- This part makes me cry every Damn time. The music gives me goosebumps. 
- And for me the sound makes this scene. So much effort went into how menacing they wanted the T-Rex to be. They merged a variety of viscerally intimidating noises to create his roar, for example, including a V8 engine and a lion's roar. I think there may even be an elephant trumpet in there. It's just beautiful sound production work that completely sells this puppet-and-CGI dinosaur as real.
- Man I never really noticed that. Thank you
- Really good point. I didn't even notice it at the time but that's the intention. The lack of the score really draws you into the suspenseful moment, pitting you alongside these people as they face this horrific situation. It's small details like this that really cements the first Jurassic Park as a cinema classic.
- That and the book and movie have vastly different plot and story,  with different characters dying / living etc.  
- I long for the days when a film like Jurassic Park was considered a popcorn flick.
- That’s the genius of Spielberg - he made a monument of cinema that is ALSO a great popcorn flick
- Watching the scenes when the scientists see the dinosaurs for the very first time... I truly experienced how transporting and magical a movie can be. I worked at a Wal Mart right around the corner from a theater and I went after or before work several times and watched it by myself because I didn't want to have to deal with other people, I just wanted to enjoy the movie on the big screen while I could. I hadn't been that enthralled with a movie since watching The Black Satallion when I was a 7 yr old horse nut. 
- [deleted]
- Agreed. The way he spitballs ideas for shots in the first preproduction meetings and they wind up in the finished film exactly as he described them... He's one of the best that ever lived.
- I was 10 when I saw it in a BIG theater.  Didn't know you could get goosebumps on your kneecaps til then.
- Forgot how much I love how the T-Rex bumps and moves the Jeep with the touch of its nose too
- 90% of /r/movies comments might as well be Gregg Turkington takes
- "Clever girl...I wish I could quit you"
- No? Well, he lives at the mountain and brakes human backs constantly. The title couldn't have been clearer. You must have seen have a different movie.
- Alternate take:

Popcorn flicks were of much higher quality before Hollywood realized someone like Michael Bay could put in far less effort and still yield them satisfactory returns.
- There's only 6 minutes of CGI in the whole movie. All the parts that "hold up" are primarily animatronics. They did an _amazing_ job on those, which is why they hold up so well.
- GET THE KIDS!
- If you haven't seen it, the making of Jaws doc (in lo-res) is on YouTube. Spielberg in his 20s thinking it's over before he realizes he SHOULDN'T show the shark, vs. trying to use 2 different fake ones, is incredible. Also great info on Shaw vs. Dreyfus. I think the camera they made so they could show both below and above water won an award as well
-  "Anybody hear that? It's an... It's an impact tremor, that's what it is... I'm fairly alarmed here."
- Definitely. I mean, Halloween is one of my favorite movies of all time, but if you were to tell me it was added to the registry years before Rebecca, I'd have called you a liar.
- It is. It's also his only movie to win an oscar for best picture.

It's my favorite movie of all time.

Edit for spelling.
- It is.
- It was his first movie made Stateside, too, I believe.  I love Rebecca, but I also think Hitchcock didn't regard it very highly and considered it to be more of a work of Selznick than his own.
- "Hey Victor!" 
- Highly recommend. It was played every year in my old high school English class, and nobody knew it was directed by a Native American until afterwards. Gives a different perspective when watching it.
- I loved his story about the fry bread
- There are other preservation initiatives with varying funds.  

The budget *this* allows for assumes a fixed amount of films. Since funds are not unlimited and archiving is not free.  
And this particular mandate focuses on quality over quantity.

And they attempt to be thorough. They preserve lab tests, rough cuts, process logs, and a myriad of related material, they don’t just buy the dvd and put it on a shelf.

750 is quite the achievement 
- [deleted]
- I suspect that the Library of Congress has far more than that on its shelves. (Just looked it up: yes, the LC typically adds 7,000 to 8,000 titles to its movie collection *per year* - [source](https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/mpcoll.html).) The "historically significant" titles are selected for additional levels of preservation that go far above adding a DVD to the shelf; hence why they limit the number of titles, since it involves active work by the staff.
- It’s a classic.
- I can never hear Rappers Delight the same way after watching that movie
- What the fuck do you watch then
- I remember seeing a lot of commercials for it and seeing the kiddified cartoon version on TV.
- This is the 2nd thread today that it's been mentioned. Universe wants me to rewatch it I guess
- The fact you remember it makes it a decent movie. Roger Ebert didnt like Freddy Got Fingered but years later he admitted that maybe the movie was something special because it's a movie he always remembered.
- The Room might be considered "culturally significant", but probably not for the right reasons that would put it in the National Film Registry.
- We’re talking about real movies, not movies that fake drug lords enjoyed.
- Never go full retard
- Mu mu muh mu mu make me ha happy
- 🎶 daddy would you like some sausage 🎶 
- That film is truly high art
- That's Kangaroo Jack: G'day USA. Get it together. 
- Is this Rebecca based off the book by Daphne Du Maurier?
- "Okay folks, time to pick this year's inductees. Our choices are: Emoji Movie 3, The Fastest And Most Furious Ever, or we can take Citizen Kane out of reserve."
- It's a great movie in terms of the performances and cinematography, but as someone who's never read the book it was really obvious that they wanted to keep elements from the novel without keeping the exposition or backstory 

The kid's psychic abilities, Room 237, and even the final reveal are *never* explained or even really make sense given the context of the movie. I don't want movies to hold my hand through every aspect of the story but it honestly felt like the production of the movie went like this:

Kubrick: "Alright, so we're going to have the hallway fill up with blood"

"Wait, why?"

Kubrick: "Because it looks rad"

".... *yeah* it does look pretty rad"
- I'm with you. I only ever watched it after having just finished the novel so I was obviously biased and I was very disappointed in the movie. It's been a while now so I keep meaning to re-watch it with an open mind.
- No, Stephen King hated the movie as well.
- It was inducted in 1991. 
- You gotta go you gotta go 
- I also think it's culturally significant because it was like the first big budget, "look what we can do with computers now days" movies. I can't really remember a movie before Jurassic Park that had really top notch CGI that still holds up today. 
- I wouldn't say the horror in Jurassic Park is underrated
- You mean [the beautiful melodica cover?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk)
- I'm gonna bash 'em right *the fuck* in!
- Not to mention, in that entire scene between them, Jack *never blinks* when he's talking to her. Really adds to the suspense and creepiness
- Not "just give me a minute, I'll become male"?
- Congratulations, you have just written a new Family Guy skit
- [deleted]
- inb4 we see homophobic tweets from 10 years ago resurface
- "Heeeeeeres johnny! ^^^and ^^^rebecca!"
- Perhaps replace Nicholson with Olivier:

> "Heeeerrreees Johnny, darling!"
- Can I imagine it with Jeff Goldblum?
- To be fair that movie was absolutely aesthetically pleasing, Wyoming has some stunning scenery.
- The producer believed the public liked a movie to be faithful to the book.
- Now that’s some petty BS I can get behind
- Does Lucas even still have the original copies or did he just burn them?
- Congress has some integrity left I see
- I love the idea that even Congress hate the special editions. In reality though I assume that is has to be the original theatrical release for it to be considered.
- Which film? What did you write?
- It gets said about a lot of artists when they die young, but losing River Phoenix is just a fucking tragedy. What an incredibly talented guy who had decades of remarkable performances left in him. It’s hard not to mourn what could’ve been with his career. 
- According to legend, Pheonix's agent wouldn't even pass the script on to him, because he thought playing gay would kill his career, so Keanu Reeves rode his motorcycle from New York to LA to hand- deliver the script.
- I just read about his death, wow. I'm not surprised it was a drug OD, but the events and way it happened are a bit crazy.

First of all, its kind of crazy how Flea and Johnny Depp and Joaquin and Rain were all there. Second of all, that sounds like an awesome club. I was only 8 years old at this time, but boy does Hollywood know how to party. Third of all, for him to just collapse and convulse and his sister Rain to try to resuscitate him with Flea and Joaquin watching, man thats just so crazy and sad. 

- I agree that it's a fantastic movie, but at the same time, a gay character being a 'street hustler' feels a little on the nose. Boys Don't Cry and Philadelphia are also important movies but my point was more, that Brokeback was the first time I saw that particular type of (very common) gay person in a leading role, what you might call someone who 'passes'. It affected me emotionally in a way none of those other films did.
- [deleted]
- >It's funny that they thought it "glorified" the gay lifestyle, though, when you really consider the events of the movie.

I can almost guarantee that nobody that said that actually saw the movie. They just saw it was a big Hollywood movie about gay people and automatically think that glorifies it.
- The same people probably complained that Requiem for a Dream glorified drug use. While those movies are vastly different they're both misunderstood by people who have closed minds.

I wouldn't say Brokeback is a cautionary tale (especially when compared to Requiem), but it uses the same tools a cautionary tale does: using realism to get the viewer to empathise with someone they may not normally be able to understand and hopefully enlighten them to have a more open mind about a way of life or situation.
- Just wanted to chime in to say you’re using the language of the opposition when you refer to “the gay lifestyle.” There’s no such thing as a gay lifestyle- there’s either being gay or not. The phrase was popularized by Christian Right politicians as a way of suggesting it’s a choice.

It’s like calling being against a woman’s right to choose an abortion “Pro-Life.” 
- I don’t remember it being glorified at all. I just remember all the people making fun of it in the most stupid way. Gay cowboys? Herp derrrrrp

Well said on everything else, though. 
- Ahead of the curb.

r/boneAppleTea
- Its comments like this that make me appreciate where I grew up, were you could openly be gay or trans and no one ever judged you. It was crazy to see the homophobic people in action.
- Lol. But the pedantic part of me actually came here to point that out. 
- "Tom Hanks is funny in everything..."

"I have AIDS"

#"HAHAHAHAHAHA"
- Granted it’s been a loooooong time since I’ve seen Philadelphia, but wasn’t it received more as an “AIDS movie” rather than a “gay movie?” Inasmuch as that distinction was prevalent in 1994
- I agree *Philadelphia* was a landmark for Hollywood, but they wouldn't even show the protagonist kiss his partner on the lips. 
- While it is a great movie it is a movie about a soft natured gay man with AIDS. It doesn’t really break the stereotypes. 
- I agree that Philadelphia is a fantastic film but his character is not breaking any molds, and my point is that Brokeback liberated gay characters from \*always\* being associated with AIDS, sex, drugs, and fashion. It was a movie about two people who love each other under difficult circumstances, and made a gay romance relatable for a lot of people.
- Crash (2004) isn't even the best movie titled Crash
- Crash is pretty fairly critiqued for its shortcomings. Most critics I've read don't think it should earned that Oscar. 
- The Oscars that year had some seriously stiff competition, but I will always cry that Heath was robbed that year and they friggen knew it.  While I definitely think he earned his award for The Dark Knight, I partially think he's the recipient of the one of four posthumous Best Actor awards because of that Brokeback Mountain snub.
- *Munich* was actually the best film that year.
- Crash is still the only movie that I’ve walked out of. To me it was overly simplistic and emotionally manipulative moralizing that still managed to be behind the times. Oh, a young Hispanic guy isn’t a bad father, how shocking. I’m glad that some people liked it and maybe it helped expose some to different points of view, but to even compare it to brokeback mountain at the time seemed insane to me. 
- 
>Crash was a fine film

No.
- You summed up my thoughts perfectly here, I was going to respond that this was far from the first mainstream or major film to not treat gays stereotypically. Just a very big one. 
- I've seen all these films! I guess my point didn't quite come across in my original message. But I do think the characters in films like My Own Private Idaho and The Watermelon Woman are characterized in a way that makes them less relatable, in my opinion. These are characters distinguished by their 'queerness'. And while it is hugely important and awesome that these characters existed on film, I think Brokeback opened up a lot of people's eyes to how \*normal\* gay people can be. The vast majority of us are just people trying to find love, and seeing that represented on film felt monumental to me.
- Fucking Crash, man.
- Fuck Karen.
- I actually get what he's saying but isn't the tragedy not that they are gay but the way their society treats them *for* being gay?

The same way that a movie about civil rights isn't saying "It's tragic that these guys are black?"

- Your professor is part of the problem. And the same kind of problem that affects bisexuals. 
- > I thought it was a western, they told me it was a western.

My friend saw it in the theatre, and as soon as the first unambiguously gay scene started (tent I guess?) a very old couple sitting in front of him got up in disgust and walked out.  Apparently the gentlemen had a walker making it even more hilarious as he slowly struggled to get out of the theatre while a 20' tall gay love scene is going on behind him in glorious surround sound.

We speculate that he and his wife probably came to the theatre and just picked the movie based on the poster thinking it would be a nice safe western.   


- Will that be before or after Sgt Kabukiman NYPD?
- Putting The Room and Maniac Cop together as examples of bad films is incongruous. Maniac Cop is a genuinely great slasher that approaches the genre from a social perspective and Lustig was a wonderfully accomplished director. Are you sure you're not thinking of Samurai Cop? Cus that's a piece of shit. 
- It did, but like you said it isn't a movie people think of when they think of Hitchcock. Even though it's his only movie to win Best Picture. It's actually an interesting film to watch if you go in not knowing it's him directing it, since it was his first Hollywood film. Can see some shades of his well known style in it. Especially his ability to make something out of the seemingly nothing, with the most important character in the movie not ever being shown.
- It was Hitchcock's only Best Picture winner, which is sad. I think Spellbound should've been another, especially since Salvador Dali designed one of the sets. 
- That's so weird, so did I. Just saw it Monday night, amazing movie
- If Congress can't get the originals there's no hope for the rest of us.
- It's like when Squidward tries to put the putty nose on the marble statue. 
- John Williams is a genius. 
- "Welcome... to Jurrasic Park" with that music sting is one of the top5 greatest moments in cinema history. Period.
- I long for a time when Hollywood actually used to cast non-action star, model-types as leads in movies. Neil was perfectly cast, but I feel like that wouldn't be possible today
- [deleted]
- Jurassic Park, wish I knew how to quit you.
- I too saw this at least a dozen times in the theater, including opening night, and a full year later when it was still playing at the dollar theater.   True game changer for CGI. 
- I remember seeing it twice when I was in second grade. I told my friend I was seeing the dinosaur movie and his parents wouldn’t let him go because I think it was PG13. I did the Simpsons character Nelson’s “ha-ha” laugh at him and enjoyed movie history 
- And this was back in the days when there's a good chance people had not watched the trailer beforehand, so the reveals were even more amazing.
- I will watch that clip every single time followed up with [this one] (https://youtu.be/Yp_LQDn0W04) 
- I saw that edit before I saw Jurassic park proper and boy does it mess with that great piece of music
- I knew someone was gonna go there, damn you XD
- I was sorely disappointed it wasn't the clip op posted
- You were so preoccupied with whether you could, you didn't stop to think if you should.
- You gotta hear it [on melodica](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk).
- I was a 13-year-old dinosaur nut. You have NO IDEA. Also, I had my first kiss at that movie. That was less spectacular that the movie. 
- Ditto. I was 13. At the time, most live-action monsters and dinosaurs looked incredibly fake. Harryhousen movies were awesome, but there wasn't much realism. CGI wasn't spectacular, and green-screening was usually obvious.

I was blown away during this scene. Everything was top notch. I felt I was finally seeing real dinosaurs. The music was perfect.

I hope my children get to experience something in a movie as revelatory as that moment was for me. Today's movies have phenomenal effects, so even a lot of the things aimed at kids look great.
- Yeah there's a baby elephant trying to trumpet pitched way down in the mix. And an alligators rumble.
- Yep, and both still amazing.  Hammond was an asshole.  Nedry had a bigger motivation to fuck Hammond.  The movie is still great and the book is still great.

Although, Malcolm was retconned in The Lost World book to still be alive.
- blame michael bay 
- Exactly! Great, smart, well-made movies that are also really accessible are kind of my jam and it's rare that you get both in one package. It's probably the main reason why I love JP so much. 
- Watching movies alone is a great way to get absorbed. Also, Black Stallion is a great film. Love it!
- > 7 yr old horse nut.   

Sounds sticky. And kinda gross.
- I was the same age when I saw it too! It was a rainy day in Kansas City and my mom was taking me to see Free Willy, but we arrived late so I suggested Jurassic Park instead. Seeing it on the big screen really was incredible, it was groundbreaking on so many levels!
- I was 5 when my dad took me to see this movie and it fucking terrified me. Those dinosaurs were so realistic I had nightmares for weeks. My mom was pissed.
- That there is a Ford Explorer and I agree.
- Good point. I think Predator, Jaws, T2, Alien and Jurassic Park can be plugged as popcorn flicks before modern movies ruined the term. Fury Road is also an example in recent times. 
- Stevan Segal would like a word 
- You really need to watch more popcorn flicks from the 80s and 90s then. It only seems like that because the ones that are remembered are the ones that stood out from the crowd of junk.
- Yeah. They look so real because they *are real.*
- Have you read the book by Daphne Du Maurier? It's also very good. 
- I just watched it for the very first time last month.  I was completely engrossed. So good.
- One of the rare movies that captures the book very well
- It’s my favorite movie of all time as well, but it’s also my favorite book.


- I absolutely love Rebecca. Book and movie are phenomenal 😍
- >more of a work of Selznick than his own.

Wasn't this the case for pretty much any Selznick movie? He was pretty much *the* auteur producer, along with Lewton and Zanuck. 


- “I’m sorry about your dad!”
- YA BETTER RUN. YA BETTER TAKE COVAAAAA!
- It's kind of a lie. 
- The cartoon one or the live action one?
- I love kangaroo jack
- I said a hip, hop, a hippie to the hop
- Do you guys not have *Kangaroo Jack*?
- The movie itself is a "kiddified" version of its pre-test screening cut - that's why there's so much oddly inappropriate violence and sexual innuendo in a movie ostensibly about the goofball chase of a wacky 'roo! As producer Jerry Bruckheimer explained:

> It really didn't start that way. It started out as just a cop movie called 'Down and Under.' What we found is that when we screened it for test audiences, the kangaroo was the biggest hit. The kids flipped over it, so we went out, spent a little more money and added a lot more kangaroo.'
- I was reminded of it last night when I watched Scary Movie 3!
- One day it will be in the Criterion collection. 
- What about Surf Ninjas? It's probably Tone Loc's best film role and the movie that established Rob Schneider as a comedic genius.
- I've never read the book but I'm gonna give you a solid 99.9% yes. Just because I asked my wife and she said that it was.
- Yes
- Yes, correct. 
- Gimme the bat
- Gayness, uh ... finds a way
- Yup that does sound like something we would read in “My Immortal World.”
- [Sorta recycled one more like it.](https://youtu.be/x4EILv3kYKQ)
- I definitely had that in mind :)
- > Wyoming has some stunning scenery

Not least of which were Ledger and Gyllenhaal
- He was not wrong.
- They actually can't accept the special editions because they're supposed to archive the theatrical versions by law. Lucas just refuses to offer them the theatrical version.
- It's widely speculated that all the perfect quality copies are ruined or turned 'special.'
- [Destroyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lykiNYpq5AI)
- He pasted the Special Edition CGI all over them.
- Harmy edition should go in instead 
- Amazing that people blame the prequels or sequels for ruining Star Wars after Lucas literally ruined the originals.
- He has a Technicolor print that he keeps in his personal collection

The movies were restored in the 1990s but the original edits were then archived (he probably isn't allowed to manipulate the original camera negatives) and the new Special Edition footage was edited into the master reels

So technically, when he says the movies don't exist he is correct, as it doesn't exist in one piece
- Dear congress,

I really like Jurassic Park. My favorite part is when the dinosaur goes rawr.
- Besides Stand by me which movie he'd was in would you recommend? 
- No kidding. He was that good as a kid and a young adult you can't help but wonder what could've been. 
- I get not going through the agent necessarily but why couldn’t he trust the postal service? 
- I'm trans and we still have nothing but caricatures mincing around, people talk to me about Ru Paul like I'm somehow relevant and assume I'm a prostitute or secretly a confused gay man, I sometimes get all three in the first conversation. Brokeback Mountain is a film that actually shows you a three-dimensional person who has an actual mind; in spite of gay cowboy pudding jokes that short story was written 20 years ago and gays have the right to marry... I'm sitting here with a passport I paid hundreds of dollars for that's no longer valid because of my name change.
- Are you saying that the pastor at my small, rural, midwestern church never watched the movie?

Impossible!
- Come on, people that say "glorifies gay lifestyle" have no idea what that lifestyle is or what "glorify" means.
- The type of people who think that acknowledging gay people exist is morally wrong. I've had to deal with to much of that shit.
- I don't know how anyone could watch Requiem for a Dream and ever think drug use is a good idea. It's way better at scaring you over where drugs lead than anything D.A.R.E. could ever dream of.
- I have never done or tried any kind of drugs (nor cigs or alcohol...I suck at parties I know) in my 25 year old life...yet after I had watched Requiem for a Dream I could empathize to the characters so much, I had been feeling devastated for many hours after I finished watching it. I was having this unsettling feeling of doom, misery and despair and I felt kinda guilty for even thinking of trying drugs at that time of my life. Needless to say I have never even thought about doing drugs since then ever again, as the "taste" Requiem had left in my brain, comes back. I also think that it is one of the movies that kinda helped me fight depression and trying to sort my life out even at this age, as whenever I watch it or think about it I think of the impact my misery might have to the few people I love.
Sorry for long text I just felt like sharing my stupid story cuz I dont ever talk about it to anyone lol
- Which is ridiculous, cause they were gay shepherds, not cowboys.
- >"Tom Hanks is funny in everything..."
>

"Ive finally survived the long ordeal of being stranded ln an island and fighting for my life. Time to return to my wife whose picture has kept me going and gave me the strength to overcome insurmountable odds."

"Ive moved on because I did not imagine you would have survived this long."

LMAO!!!!!!!!!


- From what I remember of 1994 people didn’t make that distinction at all even though it was known some heterosexuals got AIDS. It was thought of as a “gay” issue.

It was sort of like how we know that men get sexually assaulted but when talking about it or depicting it in media it’s still automatically thought of as a women’s issue.
- No, and yes. There weren't many movies that humanize gay men, which is more of what I think Op meant. While Tom Hanks' character was a bit stereotypical (soft spoken, well-mannered, into opera), he didn't wear flashy clothes or speak in a feminine way. 
- Sort of - it broke a barrier of representation and humanization in Hollywood though. It was arguably as formative for its time in the same ways as Brokeback was for _its_ time, just with a different focus. Philadelphia humanized that issue because that's what was needed most at the time, while Brokeback normalized a gay relationship which was more needed when it came out.
- The 1996 Crash I really liked :)
- [deleted]
- Munich is a great movie, but Brokeback Mountain is better.
- Crash was such a bad pick for best film.  It was the "feel good because Racism Is Bad" film.  There wasn't anything new or nuanced or subversive about that film.  The contrived coincidences (racist white cop who molest black woman has to *gasp* save her life later on!) only added to what made that film so bad to me.
- I watched 20 minutes of this film thinking it was ‘Crank’. True story.
- But there *are* no bisexuals-according to Hollywood
- Can you explain what you mean?
- They should've read the book, kids these days always on their contraptions.
- That was the way the book was written
- The [shot](http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/rebecca-1940/images/6986825/title/rebecca-mrsdanvers-photo) where Danvers, in Rebecca's room, approaches the lace curtain is really stunning. That entire sequence in Rebecca's room is something else. 
- That's one of the many problems with the Academy Awards. Being an annual event, some of the best films ever aren't Oscar winners simply because there was at least one "better" film that year.


- “It’s just another manhunt story wrapped up in pseudo-psychoanalysis. The whole thing’s too complicated, and I found the explanations toward the end very confusing.” -[Alfred Hitchcock](https://thehitchcockreport.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/alfred-hitchcock-gets-psychological-in-spellbound/)
- Absolutely. I think he’s gonna be one of those composers who has museum exhibits and stuff about him, go down in history kind of thing
- Half of Spielberg's billions should go to John Williams.
- I once read when Spielberg showed Williams an early cut of Schindlers List, Williams told Spielberg he needed a better composer. Spielberg agreed, but they were all dead.
- Let's not pretend this movie is without eye candy. Jeff Goldblum is right there in all that leather and chest hair glory.
- Yes! And Laura Dern was a badass scientist who wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty and she wasn’t hyper sexualized or defined by society’s boring beauty standards. That meant so much to me as little dinosaur loving nerd girl and I’m sad that a female character with depth is still a somewhat rare sight in today’s mainstream movies.
- Sam Neill was a well known actor from New Zealand, and they got the reaction in the scene by never revealing the Dinos until the day they shot that scene. That take is supposedly the first or second take.

Edit:  he’s from NZ
- You still have a couple standouts. I wouldn’t put Gary Oldman, Bryan Cranston, or Daniel Day Lewis in that category. Then again if you are just talking about leads in blockbusters, you’re probably right. 
- I was in 3rd grade when it came out to theaters. I saw it twice in big expensive theaters, then about 5 more times when it hit the dollar theater. Then begged my dad to take me again when it hit the drive in, in the summer. 

"Ok but this is the last god damn time I'm going to that movie!" 

hehe... then I got it on video for christmas.. jokes you pa, now you get to watch it all the time!
- And you've seen it in 3D since they released it in 3D?
😁
- Jurassic Park, I’m glad I didn’t quit you. 
- Next Summer: Brokeback T-Rex.  
- The trailers deliberately didn't show the dinosaurs.  Spielberg knows the value of under-promising and over-delivering.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bim7RtKXv90

- And the sound of a goose, which somehow is the most chilling component 
- Didn’t someone shoot a dinosaur with a bazooka in the books? 
- I’m not sure who to blame, whoever figured out that the key to getting butts in seats is a constant Frankenstein of action and comedy. There has to be a corny line every X seconds of action to remind people its a movie and ease tension.
- This is likely due to survivorship bias though. The only popcorn flicks from more than 20 years ago that we still remember are the truly outstanding ones: we don't remember all the crap that clogged the theaters back in the day.

The same phenomenon happens in popular music: we somehow think that "music was so much better back in the day" but that's because we only remember the great songs/artists and not all the crap that existed back then.
- I have, just not in a very long time. May need to dust that one off.
- His movie The Birds was (loosely) adapted from du Maurier's short story by the same name
- The movie is a great adaptation of the book *except* that it was shot in California instead of on location in the South of France and England.

If you are Californian, you can tell.

The casting, script, acting and directing are perfect.
- I'm so amazed that so many people even know the movie!  Most people I know have never heard of it and dismiss it because its "old black and white garbage".

Some of the best movies ever were done in black and white. They just don't know what they're missing.
- Not helping.
- It broke my heart, that fucking film.
- the trailer was very misleading as a child
- Your a lie.
- Live action
- The one with the hot chick
- The first time I saw it was as a kid on TV where they had edited even down even more to make it kid friendly. They completely cut out the part where he grabs the chick boobs because he thinks she’s a mirage, so in that version he literally just walks up to her and she just smashes his face in with her canteen. Little me was so god damned confused.
- It is better than some movies that already are.
- Upvote for your username, and good luck to you sir
- Good thing it's not like FG to recycle their material
- Why would Lucas refuse to offer the theatrical version?
- Does Lucas even have the rights to them anymore? How can he still refuse them?
- I‘ve seen the people who criticized the Prequels and Special Editions to death do a full 180 after the Sequels came out and call Lucas a misunderstood genius. It‘s ridiculous. 
- My Own Private Idaho, Running on Empty, and Dogfight are his best performances/movies. If you like him in those I'd also recommend giving The Mosquito Coast a shot. 
- I can't really speak to his motivations.  But if you looked as cool on a motorcycle as young Keanu Reeves, wouldn't you just take it everywhere?  
- Wouldn't everyone need a new passport if they changed their name? It seems like a national security risk if you let people use passports that don't look like them or even have the correct name on them. 
- [deleted]
- That show on Amazon, Transparent, is pretty neat for... visibility of the experience? I mean, Tambor is cisgender so you don't get the representation there, but I felt they portrayed some of the struggles well. There's still a bit of caricature-ness in his eccentricity, but there are also some supporting characters who are trans and I think they were really well done
- That movie is why I never tried heroin
- It's the same reason why American History X was popular amongst neo-Nazis and white supremacists (even though the film is so aggressively anti-racist).  It's easy to watch certain scenes out of context (via mental gymnastics) and stop watching after a certain point and "get" something out of it.
- I doubt anyone who said that ever watched the film. Or they turned it off before the second half.
- The mother's story is what got me. Seeing her put into a home, completely fried, with no way of leaving because her son won't be back. So sad. I have tried many drugs once or twice but I only smoke now. Seeing that movie definitly opened my eyes to what drug addiction can look like and probably saved my addictive self from getting a worse habit. 

And don't ever feel lame for never doing drugs (esp cigs! God I wish I had been as smart as you.) You're too old now for them to be fun and you have a pretty interesting factoid about yourself to share thats very rare.
- It's really brilliant.  The first watch is just pretty weird because, well,  it's pretty weird.  But it just gets better and better with subsequent viewings.  [Ebert's review of it is great](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crash-1997), btw.  Worth a read.
- It’s a good movie I have no intention to watch again
- There are no bisexuals to some gay and lesbian people as well. The stigma is so deep that Idk why its even a part of lgbt. 

Edit. Changed most to some. My apologies. The point still stands. You could be a hard liberal but still have bias to what identifiers in oneself “should” be. Being something doesnt make you immune to what you were being targeted as. 
- You could actually critique the reception to Brokeback on these grounds - there’s an argument to be made that the leads are bisexual rather than gay (Gyllenhaal being a few notches further along the Kinsey scale than Ledger, of course).
- It’s like being alive when Beethoven and the like were still pumping out tunes, sort of. 
- Now brace yourself as I reveal my brilliance!
- And that laugh. That laugh on the helicopter. I had it as my text tone for the longest time 
- Yeah but even he’s still a non-typical “hot guy”. He’s like the nerdy girl’s dream guy. 
- But he's hardly the lead. Yes they expanded his role from book to movie but he's still a support character. And Malcolm was supposed to be a rock star if the academic world so it makes sense he'd be somewhat attractive.
- Every time someone mentions Jeff Goldblum on Reddit I end up going down a Goldblum internet rabbit hole for a couple of hours. The man is a GOD. 
- As a sexy mathematician.
- This comment takes me back. When JP came out, I had a crush on a neighbor who basically had the reaction to the film you did. I think it’s actually what made me want to go see it cause she wouldn’t stop talking about it. Laura Dern was so very authentic and yeah unfortunately over half the female “scientist” in movies still look like Victoria’s Secret models with glasses and tight pants. Not that scientists can’t be attractive, but it’s just so over the top.

Edit: I mean, doesn’t [this girl just scream average chemistry student?](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MbZVEyJrrHQ/TezgnmQ_xNI/AAAAAAAAYDs/OZTcpQgM1LA/s1600/504474-carlydefault.jpg) What’s “worse”, is the original Transformers cartoons actually [made her a more believable character.](http://loveinterest.wikia.com/wiki/Carly)
- It’s kind of crazy Laura Dern was only 25 when she made JP - I always thought Dr. Sadler was supposed to be considerably older than that considering how she’s considered a leader in her field.
- I really hope you're just an expert troll, otherwise may god have mercy on your soul
- Most of those kinds of movie set stories are apocryphal, but this one is especially nonsensical because the dinos in that shot were CGI.
- Actually he's a New Zealander! 
- Those roles all belong to The Marvel Chrises now
- Joke’s on you, they bought the movie to save money, he probably liked it as much as you did if he took you that many times!
- No, I haven't!  I'll have to check it out.
- The 3D release was disappointing. I got it for my kids and tried to watch it with them. It suffered from a ton of ghosting and other 3D artifacts. You could tell this was a cash grab as well as virtually every 3D release. They all suffer from poor QA on the 3D effects. Not to mention the human error that can happen with 3D at home (TV too close / too far away) that will impact the appearance of 3D. it's pretty clear why the trend is so dead.
- Here’s Rexy!

I’d try to work “Rebecca” into this but I haven’t seen it.
- What a great trailer. 
- I *think* that's where the hisses came from. I need to look it up again.
- I believe Muldoon shot a velociraptor with his rocket launcher.
- I don't remember.  It's been so long since I've read them.  I should re-read them.  
- that half second deafening pause that is meant to allow the theater audience a chance to laugh without blocking out actual plot or dialogue are the worst. TV finally mostly rid itself of the goddamn laugh track and cinema more or less dusted it off and said 'FINALLY the corny meta trope I have been searching for!'
- Those corny lines are what puts me off from pretty much super hero movie. They make so many they get tiring, and many are already terrible on their own.
- Blame the audiences that still flock to see these films every year and don't care about a quality movie.
- So I looked up 1993's box office results hoping to provide more evidence to your post but... 1993 kinda ruled. https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1993
- Same. I read it maybe 10-11 years ago, but I remember it being a VERY good read. 
- Jamaica Inn as well. 
- Went to this in theatres as a 12 year old expecting a goofy talking Kangaroo who caused a bunch of nonsense and hilarity for children would ensue. I can't quite remember but I think the movie was actually some movie about mobsters and 2 idiots having to bring money to Australia and I think at one point a Kangaroo gets their money?  The Kangaroo couldn't actually talk though and there was just one scene where they were hallucinating in a desert in which it talked. That movie man. 
- What about my a lie?
- You’re
- Who looks like [this.](https://gfycat.com/briefellipticaldegus)
- >The one with the hot chick

Rob Schneider was there?
- Now you’ve got me wondering. What are the worst movies to get criterion’d?
- He‘s embarrassed by it and only wants people to remember the DVD/Special Edition versions
- Cause he's a dumb fucc
- Yeah iirc he still owns the rights to the OT in some capacity. It's why they won't be on the new Disney streaming service, at least not for a few years.
- Thanks! Will watch them in that order
- I have so many feelings about Dogfight. It’s such a rollercoaster of emotions and features probably one of the sweetest, oddest characters I’ve ever seen.
- how could that be? The schlong doctor told me I have a feminine penis!
- Nothing in this world is a bigger deterrent to intravenous drug use than watching him stick that needle into his necrotic, fucked up arm. I literally felt faint watching that. 
- For me it was Trainspotting, where the baby is crawling on the ceiling. Kinda said no to needles, but not getting high.
- This review is a great distillation of Ebert’s legendary motto that “its not what it’s about, it’s how it is about it.”
- >There are no bisexuals to most gay and lesbian people as well. 

I get people can be bigoted but let’s not be over dramatic 
- I haven't seen the film, but I read the short story, and I'd argue that that was the entire point of the narrative.

It was very much a "queer" story in that it takes something fairly standard (a love story) and changes it in a way that provokes the audience. How different is Brokeback Mountain from Romeo & Juliet, for example? 

The queer idea presented in Brokeback Mountain is that sexuality is fluid and largely performative: both men had wives and children, yet fell in love with each other. Yet how is their love for each other more or less "genuine" than their marriages in describing their sexuality? They both also react fairly differently to the end of their relationship, with Ennis not having any other same sex relationships. Jack has a few other trysts with men, but that could simply be his attempt at recreating his connection with Ennis with another man.
- All of my friends from high school band who grew up to be pro orchestra musicians would groan so loud if they read that
- I'M THE MASTER
- You've seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJelEXaPhJ8), right
- He’s what’s called “unconventionally attractive”
- Rosie Whatsherface made me miss the thespian talents of Megan Fox, somehow
- My mistake, Thanks for the correction 
- Or he was just a good father who liked to make his son happy haha 
- The writing is lovely. It one of those books where you can savor every word. Hitchcock even begins the movie using a quote from it
- Pretty much exactly that movie, and they put the smiling Kangaroo with sunglasses on the cover / posters, completely misrepresenting the movie.
- The lie is that I thought I good give equal respect to my movie goers but know that you’ve said that horrible thing, I give you no respect
- The others missed it, but I see what you did there and it was glorious!
- Which is a mortal sin. He needs to never have creative control of a Star Wars movie again.
- I thought that was because TNT owned those movie rights, which is why the Disney streaming service can only show the newest batch.
- Little Nikita is also a good one. :)
- I always thought the part where he sinks into the floor was a good way of showing the effects of opiates. To me that's how it feels. Although I've never done heroin I'm sure it's similar in feeling to other opiates
- Is it because Beethoven is so far and above? Or the opposite. I have some education in music but I’m interested in what Pro orchestra musicians think about this haha. 
- OF SUSPENSE!
- I recently read it and yes the writing was so wonderful! Completely immersive and set such a wonderful atmosphere.
- But the trailers made it out to be a talking kangaroo movie, and instead if was a stoner comedy. :V
- I mean... Lucas's worldbuilding is amazing. In my opinion, his biggest contribution to Star Wars was the worldbuilding. But editing... not so much. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFMyMxMYDNk)'s a great video about how the initial Star Wars edit sucked and how it was changed to the Oscar sweeping movie we know and love today.
- john williams, while a great composer, is known for copying music from great composers (dvorak, holst, etc.) i don’t necessarily agree with this assessment nor do i think the “copying” is intentional, but it’s pretty blatant sometimes 
- I don't even remember. I just know a lot of them think John Williams drastically overrated as a composer, but part of that probably has to do with being in/teaching high school band
- If you haven't, pick up The Little Stranger by Sarah Waters. It definitely evokes that same creepy old house vibe.
- I vaguely remember this from when I was like 6 or 7.... the trailers made it seem like he talked all the time and then he like only did in a dream sequence once in the movie 
- It may have been a “lie” but it still holds a special place in my heart.
- The Imperial March sounds so much like Mars, Bringer of War because he was told "make it sound like Mar, Bringer of War." That's an important consideration when assessing a composer that a lot of people neglect. John Williams can be handed a movie and sometimes a piece for inspiration to go with it and turn out something so unique and memorable that it outshines the piece it was derived from.
- I can see that. Beethoven is by far my favorite composer and I sometimes feel cheesy for it because he’s so well known but no one moves me like he does musically speaking. John Williams is amazing to me more for being able to capture my imagination by picking exactly what needs to be where in the film/score which is its own thing. But I can see him being overrated if you don’t enjoy the movies he was a part of. 
- John Williams gets a bad rep from some band directors/local pro players because of the popularity and annoyance of some his composition after 40 years, but he’s a master of both composition and orchestration. Any of his Star Wars music, especially some of the 70s could hold its own against any contemporary wind ensemble music. 
- You must have stopped watching before the end credits rolled.
- I'm glad it brings you happiness then. :)

==================================================
Post Title: James Cameron attempted to buy the rights to the novel "Jurassic Park", but Spielberg beat him by a few hours. He described his version as "'Aliens' with dinosaurs." What other movies would be totally different with a new director?
Author: Naweezy
Score: 39589
Content:
Cameron on his approach to Jurassic Park: “But when I saw the film, I realised that I was not the right person to make the film, he was. Because he made a dinosaur movie for kids, and mine would have been aliens with dinosaurs, and that wouldn't have been fair."Dinosaurs are for 8-year-olds. We can all enjoy it, too, but kids get dinosaurs and they should not have been excluded for that. His sensibility was right for that film, I'd have gone further, nastier, much nastier."

What other movies would be totally different or would you liked to have seen with a new director?

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- Sergio Leone's The Godfather.   Yes, he was the original director asked to direct.
- Coppola wanted Scorsese to direct Godfather II. Coppola went round after round with Bob Evans at Paramount and Evans eventually said "over my dead body." As part of the deal of Coppola directing Part II, Evans promised the studio wouldn't get involved at all and Coppola had carte blanche over the entire production. 

I'm really curious how Scorsese would have approached the film especially in his relative youth in 1974.
- Spielberg was a fan of Doom when it came out, and he actually talked to Id Software about doing a movie of it. My mind boggles of what Steven Spielberg would do with a Doom movie. Would he make it PG-13, or would he make it scary, bloody, and rated R? Would he make the demons as memorable as the raptors and dinos in Jurassic Park? Im sure the action setpieces would be quite nice.

It never made it past the talking stages, and years later we got the Rock movie, which was in the "ok, I guess" range aside from a nice first person sequence, and a truly dogshit direct to streaming movie Doom: Annihilation. Ive actually watched it. Dont watch it.
- Danny Boyle’s version of James Bond
- Christopher Nolan's 'The Aviator' with Jim Carrey. I remember reading somewhere that Nolan said it was the "best script he'd written"
- I have often been curious what David Fincher's Spider-man would have been like.

He wanted to get through the origin in a 5 minute intro montage, then the rest of the story would have been about "The Death of Gwen Stacey". Sounds ballsy, but I mean... it's David Fucking Fincher.
- * Terry Gilliam’s [Watchmen](https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-insane-way-terry-gilliams-watchmen-movie-w-1533286624)
* Guillermo Del Toro’s Hobbit, or even Peter Jackson’s Hobbit had he be given the time and leeway to make it like he had with LOTR
* Darren Aronofsky’s Wolverine
* George Miller’s Justice League
* Sasha Baron Cohen’s Queen/Freddie Mercury movie, I think David Fincher was involved in some capacity
- Tim Burton's Superman, with Nic Cage as Superman.

It.Almost.Happened 😳
- David Lynch’s Return of the Jedi would have been pretty interesting.
- Having read Jurassic Park, I could easily see how it could become Aliens but with Dinosaurs. 

>!Seeing as how Muldon and the Lawyer become a raptor killing team and end up killing their way into the raptors nest/hive and survive the whole thing. And the T-Rex is almost hunting Grant and the Kids the whole novel, or at least they keep having run ins with it chasing them. Though the Yoshi tongue bit I'm still glad has never seen the light of day.!<
- An Edgar Wright version of Ant Man
- Cronenberg almost made TOTAL RECALL with Richard Dreyfuss. Was going to be a very cerebral type flick instead of what happened when Schwarzenegger’s people acquired the rights.
- Ever heard of James Cameron's Spider-Man?
- Edgar Wright's Ant-Man is one that comes to mind. Apparently it was supposed to be more of a dark comedy. I love the Ant-Man films as they are, but when they announced Wright is what got me onboard in the first place.

Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim sequel. Would have loved to his take on the purposed half Kaiju Jaegers. I pictured a lot of body horror elements going on, something akin to Nurgle Space Marines.

A cancelled film that I was very interested in was Neil Blomkamp's Aliens sequel. The concept art and plot pitch he gave sounded fascinating to me. Damn shame we didn't get to see it.
- Mel Brook’s “The Exorcist”.
- Terry Gilliam’s film adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s *Good Omens*. It was rumored at one point to star Robin Williams as Aziraphale and Johnny Depp as Crowley. Although I love the Amazon miniseries, that would have been something to behold.
- The original novel was way more violent and brutal than the movie. The first chapter has a nanny walking into a nursery to find a dinosaur tearing strips of flesh off a baby.

Edit: I went back and checked and I was wrong. That happened in chapter four, not chapter one. Chapter one has a little girl attacked by a dinosaur but she survives.
- Didn’t see it in comments so I came to say the Alien film by Neill Blomkamp.
- Ridley Scott's I AM LEGEND

Peter Weir's SALEM'S LOT

John McTiernan's BATMAN FOREVER along with McTiernan's Cut of EATERS OF THE DEAD

Mel Gibson's FAHRENHEIT 451 (with Frank Darabont's screenplay and music composed by James Horner)

John Carpenter's FIRESTARTER with Tangerine Dream and Giuseppe Ruzzolini still onboard as composer and cinematographer

George A. Romero's PET SEMATARY

John Boorman's THE STAND

Cary Fukunaga's IT
- [deleted]
- David Fincher’s The Amazing Spider-Man (before Webb). 

Apparently Sony wanted to relaunch Spidey in an auteur-driven reboot after to rival Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy but they didn’t have the balls to hire someone like Nolan.

Fincher wanted to skip the origin story and start with him already as Spider-Man and begin the film with him meeting Gwen and ending with Gwen dying by the hands of the Goblin. 

I also just wish we got a Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross Spidey soundtrack, haha.
- Aronofsky was attached to both Wolverine and Robocop, and I still imagine what those could have looked like.
- Jodorowsky's Dune would have been very interesting to see
- In hindsight, James Cameron should've directed The Lost World. It's more up his alley and while it wouldn't have been violent enough to garner an R-rating (the suits would prefer to have the JP brand to be marketable to kids), but it would be more intense than what Steven Spielberg has done.
- What would the Hobbit have been like as one movie Directed by Guillermo del Toro?
- [deleted]
- [deleted]
- Quinton Tarantino Star Trek

I'm not sure it'll ever be a thing, but I'd love to see how frikkin weird it would be
- AI, Kubrick
- I always wonder what A. I. would have been like if Stanley Kubrick lived to make it and it wasn't Steven Spielberg making it as a tribute to him.
- Baz Luhrmann's Into the Woods
- Colin Trevorrow’s version of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.
- >James Cameron attempted to buy the rights to the novel "Jurassic Park", but Spielberg beat him by a few hours. He described his version as "'Aliens' with dinosaurs."

This was simple case of "whoever wins, we win as well"

Coin toss went to Spielberg
- Superman Lives is pretty much the go-to answer for this question but seriously: a Superman movie directed by Tim Burton, written by Kevin Smith and starring Nicolas Cage as Superman? Sign me up!
- Ron Howard made a very safe, by-the-numbers Solo movie that felt like it took zero chances. It's fine, but I really wanna know what it might've looked like if you turned the Spiderverse dial up to 11.
- >Mel Gibson’s Good Will Hunting

Believe it or not, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck originally wrote Good Will Hunting as a taut thriller, concerning the FBI trying to use Damon’s troubled young genius as a spy. It was only until Rob Reiner told the pair to focus on the relationship between the young whizz and an enigmatic psychiatrist (Robin Williams) did they have a hit drama on their hands. From there it wound up in the mitts of Kevin Smith, who, deciding he wouldn’t ‘dare direct’ such a beautiful movie, walked into Harvey Weinstein’s Miramax office and said ‘Drop what you’re doing and read this’, or so recounted Damon years later. For a few months after it was developed by Mel Gibson, blue face-paint still fresh from his Braveheart Oscar win. Eventually, of course, it went to Gus Van Sant.

That would be unrecognizable with Mel Gibson.  I love me so.e Kevin Smith but I'm really glad he passed.  He knew he was out of his depth there.
- I’d like to see a Tim Burton fresh off of Batman Returns remake Willy Wonka. Back when he cared about practical effects and being super bizarre, as opposed to the “Mr. Paycheck” he became in the 00s. PLUS just think about the people he worked with a lot then, it would’ve had a great cast. #KeatonAsWonka
- Aliens with Dinosaurs sounds more true to the book TBH.
- David Cronenberg was the first director attached to American Psycho, and didn't want any club or restaurant scenes in it. Which is deeply weird since something like half of the book takes place in various restaurants and clubs.

Ridley Scott was supposed to do I Am Legend with Arnold in the late 90s. Everyone likes to go on about the makeup effects, but I'm more intrigued by how it was meant to be largely dialogue free for much of it.
- In the book, Muldoon wasn't a useless idiot who bumbled himself into immediate death accomplishing nothing. He had a fucking *grenade launcher*.

Ahh, what could have been.
- Stanley Kubrick's "My Cousin Vinny"
- [deleted]
- I wonder how Kubrick's A.I. Artificial Intelligence would had differed from Spielberg's.

Edgar Wright's Ant Man.

It hasn't been made, but I was excited for Guillermo Del Toro's Haunted Mansion movie, but thats moved on to a different director I think...
- I would love to see Tarantino direct True Romance. It's a pretty perfect film but he wrote it and didn't get to direct it. I'm curious how he would have done it differently.
- Jurassic park is insane though.

you can watch it today and not be annoyed with the CGI,  and it came out in fucking 1993...
 
hard to believe.
- James Cameron's Or Even John Carpenter's Alien.
- Cheating, but I wish we could have seen the “let’s take a chance on this Fincher kid!” version of Alien 3, instead of the “let’s all bully the Madonna guy” we got instead.

The plots a little thin but the premise is solid, it was a healthy reset for the series, the cast was great. The fact they got *anything* out of suggests some solid bones. Oh well.
- A few years later somebody would make Carnosaur 2, which is *really* Aliens with dinosaurs.
- Thor: Ragnarok with Uwe Boll as the director.
- [deleted]
- Spielberg's Jurassic Park is one of the pivotal defining moments in cinematic history. The movie still holds up incredibly well, even as its sequels are various levels of weak.
- I misread the title as Cameron's vision involving aliens and dinosaurs. To be fair, Jurassic Park in the style of *Aliens* would be cool, but dinosaurs beating up aliens and rangers getting abducted by UFOs would be very fun to see.
- "Aliens with Dinosaurs" would be closer to the book, I think.
- Quentin Tarantino doing his own version of The Wizard of Oz.
- >Dinosaurs are for 8-year-olds.

tf?  I'm a 49 y/o woman and have been obsessed with dinosaurs my whole life.  Are you supposed to stop finding them fascinating at a certain age or something?  They are the most amazing creatures to ever rule this planet.  

They were titans with incredible weaponry and the brutal violence that was apart of everyday life back then was incredible. Why would anyone say they belong to kids?  They were the embodiment of graphic violence on land and in the sea.

Would you say that great whites, anacondas and crocodiles belonged to kids?  Because they're basically kittens compared to what was around back then.  One look at an actual titanoboa would give a kid nightmares for life.

While I loved Jurassic Park, I'd pay a lot of money to see Cameron's version be made.
- "Sandman" made by Terry Gilliam would have been great...a colossal flop, but still great!
- He made Once Upon a Time in America to make up for passing on the Godfather, so imagine that's how he would have done it.
- I like David Lynch's *The Godfather*. He makes them an offer they can't understand.
- Kurosawa with The Godfather.
- [deleted]
- Scorsese also wanted to make Gangs of New York in the 1970s with DeNiro as Bill the Butcher. 

I love Daniel Day Lewis but seeing those set designs in the 70s would have been so unique. Plaid pants for example were in style in 1870 and 1970.
- Obviously it would be Doom guy stuck with 2 kids. The kids would be dragged through hell and mostly getting in the way until the last 10 minutes. That's when they save the universe.
- While Cameron said Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" was the right version, I feel that Cameron's "Doom" would be the right version. I'd want something dark, dirty, gruesome and scary as fuck! Not whatever Spielberg would do with it.
- We know one thing. It couldn't have been better than the cinematic masterpiece that Andrzej Bartkowiak directed in 2005 staring The Rock.
- Can we just have fucking Karl Urban be Doom Guy already? They had the right man for the job as far as I'm concerned, he made a great Judge Dredd. Just make it a damn good movie where he fucks up demons where they are terrified of him.
- Tarantino says he pitched *Casino Royale* to the Broccolis as soon as they got the rights to the book back. There's always been this (rumored) unspoken rule with the Broccolis that no American will ever be allowed to direct a James Bond film (except now with Cary Fukanaga doing *No Time to Die*) which is why Spielberg got turned down multiple times. But still, it's Tarantino, so they agree to a meeting. Tarantino had three stipulations:  


1. It would be in black-and-white
2. It would be set in the '60s
3. Pierce Brosnan would be Bond and Uma Thurman would be Vesper Lynd

The Broccolis consider this, thank Quentin for his time and leave. Tarantino goes to see *Royale* after it's finished and sees the opening is done completely in black-and-white. From then on, he says they stole his idea.
- Steven Soderbergh's version of Bond would've been interesting, as well.
- [removed]
- Jim Carrey as Howard Hughes is inspired casting.
- So Leo and Scorsese have a history of getting this big stories over other big names I see. I came here to see if anyone would mention Wolf of Wall Street. I believe there was talks about it potentially going to Brad Pitt as the lead instead but without Scorsese. A couple years later we got a Leo/Pitt/Tarantino movie though, and I like to think it was all for the best. I know Leo an Tarantino have a few other projects in the works. I saw a photo of Leo's latest character, but I'm patiently waiting for Devil in the White City.
- Sounds like Steven Segal.

Segal; "I've just read the greatest script I've ever read"

Random guy; "Who wrote it?"

Segal; ".....I did"
- Now I’m imagining Spider-Man with Aaron Sorkin writing the script. Just the “do you think I deserve your attention?” scene but it’s Jameson talking to Peter.
- Sounds like what spider verse did. A short montage to establish the character and move on with the story.
- [deleted]
- > Sasha Baron Cohen’s Queen/Freddie Mercury movie
  
This one is such a missed opportunity. 
  
> Sacha Baron Cohen was signed on to portray the late Freddie Mercury in a Queen biopic, but in 2013 he dropped out of the project.
   
> Speaking to the US radio host Howard Stern, Baron Cohen said he hoped to present a “warts ‘n’ all” view of the legendary singer’s hedonistic lifestyle, but Mercury’s former bandmates were more concerned with protecting their legacy.
   
> The comedian and actor said: “A member of the band – I won’t say who – said: ‘You know, this is such a great movie because it’s got such an amazing thing that happens in the middle.’”
   
> “And I go: ‘What happens in the middle of the movie?’ He goes: ‘You know, Freddie dies.’ ... I go: ‘What happens in the second half of the movie?’ He goes: ‘We see how the band carries on from strength to strength.’
   
> “I said: ‘Listen, not one person is going to see a movie where the lead character dies from Aids and then you see how the band carries on.’“There are amazing stories about Freddie Mercury. The guy was wild. There are stories of little people walking around parties with plates of cocaine on their heads!”
   
Just imagine such a raw and authentic Mercury biopic.
- Can we add the scrapped Guillermo Haunted Mansion? Using the original ride story boards with Guillermo's directing would have been amazing.
- Darren Aronofsky’s Wolverine

That would be crazy but probably would have been similar tonally to the later released Logan which was great.
- >Guillermo Del Toro’s Hobbit

This one really is a travesty
- aronofskys batman also
- Del Toro would've been ideal for The Hobbit, I think. Look how he blended adult and child fantasy in Pan's Labyrinth. Could've been something special. Oh well.
- Darren Aronofsky’s Batman Begins/Batman Year One is another one. Nolan did an amazing job with Batman Begins, but to have seen Aranofsky’s original vision and expand into a trilogy would have either been amazing or perfect “How Did This Get Made” podcast fodder.
- > Terry Gilliam’s Watchmen

I'd like to see his Harry Potter
- Quentin Tarantino's Star Trek would have also been amazing to watch. Apparently the script he pitched was pretty well received.
- It's the last one I'm actually sad about. The movie we got isn't a bad movie by any means but it is definitely a safe and kinda boring tale compared to what actually happened.
Freddie has famously said do what you like with my image after I'm dead just don't make me boring (I'm paraphrasing it's not a direct quote) and the made the safest most boring movie they could.

Yes I'm also awhere that the movie is about queen over all and not just Freddie but face it Freddie was queen and the band just hasn't been quite as good without him (personality I think they should have retired the name queen after he passed and started a new band without him as they are still quite talented with out him but yeah there's no replacing Freddie)
- > George Miller’s Justice League

Regardless of what people think of Sneider's version, George Miller's take on Justice League would have been wild!
- >or even Peter Jackson’s Hobbit had he be given the time and leeway to make it like he had with LOTR

I agree, but even aside from time and leeway, some awful fucking decisions were made. Like the pointless love triangle, the orc villain following them through their journey, or the idiotic liquid gold statue. Those didn't have anything to do with time; just horrible decision making.
- No ones talking about George miller’s Justin league, I think of all of these that would have been the best.
- According to Peter Jackson he basically ran with Del Toro's Hobbit movie and had no time or funding to make changes to make it into something good.  All the cast was hired, the sets were built, the storyboards were made... there was no budget to start over.
- Tim Burton's Batman 3, with Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, eventually leading to Tim Burton's Superman with Nic Cage, and a Tim Burton DC Universe.

Micheal Keaton's Batman fighting Nic Cage's Superman ...
- Have you read the screenplay? It’s… odd.
- [deleted]
- I had no idea this was a real possibility. I'm terrified of what the cute little teddy bear Ewoks would have been with David Lynch.
- [deleted]
- I believe David Cronenberg was also approached for this film. I think Luke and Vader would have wound up as one being and the film would have landed halfway between The Fly and Dead Ringers in tone. Maybe Leia in the Videodrome torture room?
- There was never any real chance of this happening, Lynch was never interested from the start
- I think you could just rent Dune, and you'd have a good idea what it might look/feel like.
- Robert Forster as Boba Fett
- *Jurassic Park* is really one of those movies I could see being remade decades into the future with the primary selling point being that it's more closely adapted from the book.  The movie we got is absolutely a classic and still holds up after all this time, but it really wouldn't surprise me for someone to try considering how many differences there are between the movie and novel.
- That scene is sort of in the second film
- Most of the book is put into the following movies. T. rex stalk became the spinosaurus instead. Yoshi tongue is in lost world
- They didn't do Muldon justice in the movie..barely any screentime
- I was pretty bummed when he left the project. I love Ant Man, but seeing Wright's version would have been amazing
- Losing Edgar Wright (and pissing off Joss Whedon) are at least partly what led Kevin Feige to petition the Disney board to separate Marvel Studios from Marvel Entertainment (micromanaged by Ike Perlmutter and the 'creative committee'), which led to *much* better, more diverse, and more creative films.
- Loved Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Great comic and anime vibes throughout. Id be excited to see Wright take on a new superhero franchise.
- [deleted by user]
- I adore the Schwarzenegger movie we got, but a Cronenberg version sounds incredible. Wish we got that instead of the lame reboot version.
- I read the script. Spider-Man fucks Mary-Jane on top of the Brooklyn Bridge, in his spidey suit, in the rain. I also remember there being several F-bombs alluding to a solid R rating.
- No but I have heard of James Cameron's Aquaman
- "Your mother sucks cocks in hell!"

"Finally, my father can rest in peace!"
- Instead of calling a priest, a rabbi shows up
- Did you know that Mel Brooks was the producer of *The Elephant Man*?
- Gilliam adapting anything Gaiman/Pratchett would be awesome…
- It'd be so hard for him to top what they ended up making.  [Like the M25 scene was done almost as if Terry Gilliam had made it himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S3a32RzEo).
- Came here to say this. I love the film, but the novel had very graphic and specific descriptions of dinosaurs tearing people apart. Dennis Nedry's death comes to mind.
- Those opening chapters were fantastic. All the scientists being dumbfounded by how they are holding actual dinosaur tissue samples, that one scientist finding a decaying dinosaur body that was seemingly tagged.

Crichton really knew how to set the stage; right out of the gate, it was clear the dinosaurs were escaping off the island.
- I read the book this winter and it's pure horror. I couldn't put it away. One of the best books I've read.
- I think a James Cameron "Aliens with dinosaurs" would have worked just as good as Spielberg's. The novel already kinda was Aliens in terms of tone.

Plus I'm still butthurt about how Stephen did my boy Gennaro dirty.
- Damn.
- Could be a heavy dose of nastolgia, but I read the book as an adult and thought it was ok but wasn't endeared to any of the characters. Spielberg taking the premise and reworking the characters and story was the smartest thing he could do.
- Or his Halo movie. That test footage he did was so awesome.

Edit: here's the little video he did https://youtu.be/Hk0SBXrm4nQ
- Also, Halo by Neil
- I was looking for this comment. Fuck the Prometheus trilogy.

Ridley Scott is to Aliens as George Lucas was to Star Wars.

Edit: I couldn’t say how magnificent Blomkamp’s Aliens entry would be; but it would have been amazing to see Weaver and Biehn back in a direct sequel to Aliens—far more amazing than the movies to which this movie lost.
- It’s a shame that we will never get to see that George Romero pet sematary movie…I mean, even if he was still alive we probably still wouldn’t, but him being dead makes it more sad
- I wish we had got Fukunaga's IT. Whilst what we did get wasn't without flaws, I think there was a lot to like, particularly in the first chapter. However, what the movies suffered from most, I think - in chapter two more so than chapter one - was a lack of just letting the characters breathe. It just jumped from set piece to set piece, scare to scare. It shone in the quieter moments.

I think Fukunaga could've nailed that slower pace, that quiet introspection, if the first season of True Detective is anything to go by.
- Holy shit Ridley Scott’s I AM LEGEND would have been a god-level post-apocalyptic odyssey, probably for the best we never got it thought would have likely made every zombie movie after it look like complete garbage
- I loved The Lost World but that movie would have been more up Cameron's alley, I think.
- Yeah, I wouldn’t want to replace Spielberg’s JP with Cameron’s JP, but if Cameron wants to make his own bloodier/gorier dinosaur movie now, I’d watch it
- Anyone else here think that a Cameron written and directed Jurassic Park would have been closer in tone to the novel?
- That guy was fucking dedicated

Shame it didn't pan out

Regardless of how final movie would have ended up being it would have certainly been mindblowing as he intended

And the people he had lined up definitely had what it took to pull it off, man has eye for talent
- Someone combined the storyboards and scripts so that you can read the full extent of his vision: https://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowskys-dune-uncovered/1

It was absolutely insane, the movie starts out with ultra intelligent dogs, who are now the dominant form of life in the universe and then they visit a museum of human history. Also, the emperor's throne room is reached by an escalator that goes into a giant jester statue's asshole. [Image 2 and it's NSFW](https://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowskys-dune-uncovered/4)
- I’m glad it didn’t because it would have skewed peoples opinions of Dune and it probably wouldn’t have recovered for half a century. 

I just want a copy of the big book.
- Though I love JP3, perhaps give that one to him. He would have made things more cohesive and the story more fluid.
- GDT wanted two movies. He also designed a version of Smaug that was more of a serpent than a dragon. From everything I read about it the studio wasnt impressed. 

I think if the studio had the gumption to go all out and let GDT make his own imagination of the Hobbit it would have been amazing. But they wanted to keep the same character designs as the LotR. I want a version of Gollum completely created by GDT. The version in the animated movie is bit of nostalgia for me and I think GDT would have made something closer to that. GDT also stated that the most important, or well known, part of the Hobbit was the riddle scene which is me and my brother's favorite part.
- It would be interesting to see Anderson, with his unique directing style, take on a drama or more serious type of movie
- This would be where Bill Murray finally gets his Oscar.
- I read the screenplay for Superman Lives, and I was like… so he loses his powers but he has an Iron Man suit that mimics his powers until he gets them back? Um… okay.
- I know everyone assumes Tarantino Trek would be all bare feet, dance scenes, 70s music, trunk shots, and witty dialogue about nothing, but I think he could write a really good straight-forward Star Trek movie without it being a parody of his own style.
- Wasn’t Tarantino interested in doing the James Bond reboot after Brosnan left? He would have gotten Clive Owen as Bond, and would have made it as a throw back style to the 50s/60s like the original Connery movies. Execs didn’t like that, wanted to keep it present day, lots of futuristic weapons/tech. Probably would also have been rated R
- [Set your phasers to thrill.](https://youtu.be/v3Nv2R9Acec)
- Lotsa green girl feet shots.
- Plenty of monologuing about what they call a Big Mac on the Klingon homeworld.
- Didn't he always intend for Spielberg to direct it?
- I’ve always wondered about this one.  And his concept was to film it over years in a way that the one brother literally grows up and mom gets older while the AI stays young.  His version was also much sadder and darker.
- Would have been better than what we got. And even though the ending we got fucked me up for a week when I was a kid, I shudder to think the impact Kubrick's version would have had on me
- *Anyone else's* Into The Woods. Whoever would have made the version of Into The Woods where I didn't see it and I can get that 2 hours of my life back.
- Finn leading a Stormtrooper uprising would have been fantastic and a much better use of the character than what we got.
- I remember looking into the plot synopsis of that a while ago. Seemed interesting.
- It was called Duel of the Fates and the storyboards from it make it look a lot better than what we got.
- At the very least, Trevorrow’s script for Duel of the Fates felt like an organic continuation of TLJ. In the trilogy we got, the shifts between each movie and the previous one were downright jarring.
- Someone [made a comic](http://awinegarner.squarespace.com/duel-of-the-fates) out of his script. 

Enjoy, people!
- Also, you know, the giant robot spider. Because spiders are the fiercest killers in the insect kingdom.
- I thought Solo was fun, but a Lord/Miller Solo is one of those great unanswered questions. Part of me thinks it’d be amazing, while part of me thinks it would have been self-parody.
- I think the whole idea of a Solo origin story was a doomed enterprise from the start, no matter who made the film.

One of the biggest things that makes Han Solo such an awesome character is that he has a mysterious past.  Sure, he says a lot of impressive sounding things, but you don’t know if he’s really done any of them or if he’s just conning a farm boy and an old man into thinking he’s awesome and worth the money.  There *might not even be such a thing as a Kessel Run.*

I mean, obviously the extended universe ruins a lot of this too, but you have nothing to gain with a Solo origin story—only the chance to undermine an already great character by not living up to the audiences expectations… And even if you DO live up to those expectations, you only succeed in destroying the mystery. -.-
- Give Han a best friend whom is a talking pie?
- This is gonna be controversial, but I don’t think it would have worked. Their style doesn’t seem like it would fit Star Wars at all, and people were saying Alden Ehrenreich needed an acting coach on set because his performance was like Ace Ventura. I’m sure if Ron Howard was hired before production began it would go from decent to really good.
- I'd love to see Burton do a real horror movie. Take his twee Hot Topic faux-horror aesthetic and do something really nasty with it.

Krampus is nothing to do with him but it kind of scratches this itch. I described it to my wife ad National Lampoons Christmas that devolves into The Mist, via Nightmare Before Christmas.
- Big Fish was the only good movie he made in his Mr. Paycheck phase.
- And Gennaro wasn't a spineless, money-obsessed lawyer who left the kids to die.
- [deleted]
- I could still see it being funny, just more tightly cued on lines and camera angles. Like Dr. Strangelove.
- John Carpenter's JP. Snake Pliskin dropped onto Isla Nublar to save the First Lady from compys would be awesome.
- Tommy Wiseau would be roughly equivalent.
- Del Toro’s The Hobbit 😢
- The fact he filmed it concurrently with Schindler’s List, another all time great, is just insane.
- What an amazing movie. One of my all time favorites.
- He always went to bat for the young guys but, I agree. It just doesn't make sense on the surface to have Scorsese make the leap from Mean Streets to Godfather II. 

There's a great story where George Lucas was in a meeting with Copolla and another executive with the script for 'American Graffiti.' The executive didn't like it and didn't get it. Copolla told the executive that he should be on his knees thanking Lucas for writing a hit movie lol.
- i think Scorsese’s 70s style woulsnt have worked for godfather tbh. I think his style now, which is a lot more operatic and epic, could work, but he was making stuff like Taxi Driver and Mean Streets then, grittier, smaller scale stuff. The Godfather is shakesperean. It wouldnt have worked.
- > Coppola must have been crazy

He had a Coppola screws loose.
- Coppola never really loved The Godfather series, afaik, at least not on a personal level like you’d expect given it’s meant to be his magnum opus. So I suppose I can understand if he’d just won an Oscar, established himself as a filmmaker and wanted to hand the series to a promising director with a genuine interest in the whole Italian American gangster topic. 

Especially seeing as Coppola probably had other ideas for projects he wanted to explore beyond The Godfather and like the other commenter says Coppola’s always batted for the young ones. I mean a similar thing happened a few years later when Lucas handed the reigns over to Kirshner to direct Empire Strikes Back ..and the result was the best movie in the Star Wars series. So I guess that makes Coppola’s thinking seem less crazy in retrospect.
- Coppola and Scorsese were from the same generation of directors. Coppola was born in 1939 and Scorsese in 1942. 

Coppola's only real film as director before the negotiations on The Godfather II started was... The Godfather. 

These were both two young directors in their early 30s making a mark in Hollywood for the first time.
- Doom guy is fighting the Icon of Sin, and somehow the kids hack a Unix system and fry the circuit parts that are attached to him.
- Saving Private Ryan? Jaws? Minority Report? They aren’t R, but he can easily do darker films.

Edit: Misremembered SPR’s rating.
- Cameron's Doom would probably look quite a bit like "Aliens."
- 4. Vesper Lynd is barefoot in every scene
- Tarantino [pitched a Star Trek movie](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/08/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-idea-1930s-gangster-movie-1234578751/) to Paramount. As of now it's not going anywhere, but it's very odd, to wonder what could have come out of it.
- I wish he would just do a 60-70s era spy thriller. I’d love to hear a James Bond type deliver his dialogue
- > Pierce Brosnan would be Bond and Uma Thurman would be Vesper Lynd

Fuck me this would be amazing
- Brosnan was such a rad Bond. I know his Bond films digressed quickly from Goldeneye but there are little scenes here and there that are perfect.
- James Bond: international art theif.
- Or Spielberg's.

Though then we probably wouldn't have ever gotten Indiana Jones.
- He probably would’ve gone full Hughes and slept in his plane or something like that lmao
- Do you know if Devil in the white city is actually in production?

I know he bought the rights a couple years back, but haven't heard anything yet.
- In fairness to the big Chrissy N there's a huge difference between "The greatest script ever" and "The best script *I've* written"
- Random guy: How do you know so much about writing scripts?

Segal: I've been writing scripts for like 47 years.
- "You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for the 30%. I'm coming back for everything!" but it's Harry Osborn talking to Peter.
- I'm imagining a scene where John Spencer walks briskly through a sharply lit hallway in an expensive 90s suit, discussing something of grave importance yet vaguely topical. Spiderman responds, also wearing a suit with excessive shoulder pads, crawling along the wall to his right. One of them says something witty.
- What the 2008 Incredible Hulk did, too. The opening credit's montage was how Banner became Hulk and the rest was the consequences of that.

Which made sense, too, since they wanted to distance it from the 2003 Hulk, so they made sure the audience who knew about that movie knew this wasn't a sequel (even though it did pick up right where the 2003 one left off, with Bruce in South America).
- And with stories like Spiderman, where it's so well documented and known what the origin story is, they should just do a 5 minute thing or do what they did in civil war where RDJ interrupts Peter before he can say it
- One of the reasons Blade was good is they just started with action. Then there was exposition between characters to explain why they were the way they were.
- I was glad Elton John was open and honest about his issues in Rocket Man
- When someone asked Elton John why his biopic wasn't pg13 he said "well I haven't lived a pg13 life"

Yeah, when I heard that Sacha dropped out of the movie and why, I decided not to see it. I still haven't.
- Bohemian Rhapsody isnt a biopic, either of Queen or Freddie Mercury. You could've had a more faithful to the truth script that was done tastefully and with the same cast and crew and retained a truer sense of what being in the band was like.

I enjoyed the movie but it was too sanitised and too geared towards Freddie AIDS diagnosis and death from the off - and he hadn't even been diagnosed at the point the movie ends.

Nor did the band part ways prior to Live Aid (they'd just finished a world tour), nor was Freddie the first to do a solo deal (that was Roger IIRC). The point about sharing song credits didn't happen until 1988/9 for The Miracle album either. 

Sorry! That turned into a bit of a rant!! I guess seeing how Rocketman told Elton's story in a positive but uncompromising way highlighted the flaws in BR for me.

- I’d take this over the factually incorrect sanitized bullshit we got any day
- >but Mercury’s former bandmates were more concerned with protecting their legacy.

I guess I get that, Baron Cohen is known for ridiculous parody.

 >I go: ‘What happens in the second half of the movie?’ He goes: ‘We see how the band carries on from strength to strength.’

Wait, wut?
- I still cannot help but feel a yearning for what could have been.
- The final version of Bohemian Rhapsody is so disjointed even though it doesn't need to be.

- Queen literally had to work a long time to be successful. BR shows them basically hitting stardom when Freddie joined, and that they met Freddie at random when their original lead singer quit. **This did not happen.** Freddie, Brian, Roger and Tim Staffell, the original lead singer, all knew each other from school, and literally lived in the same apartment for years. There could have been scenes about how Freddie sometimes felt left out from the other three, since he really wanted to be in their band, even though he was already in a few other bands, it could've been great development to show that people dismissed Freddie

- Even when Freddie joined Smile which became Queen in 1970, they went through several bass players, one of whom only lasted two shows because he stole the spotlight from Freddie, to the point where they pretended to break up because none of them had the balls to kick the bass player out

- Their demo tape in 1971 was rejected by every label, to the point where EMI offered to release it themselves, and the band could only record their first album during studio downtime and in the middle of the night, they would literally have their gear ready and have to wait until the studio called them

- **The band was planning on breaking up if A Night at the Opera wasn't successful.** They weren't making a lot of money, even if they were touring, and they wanted to put everything into making an album that would sell well

- **The band never broke up in the 1980s. Live Aid wasn't a reunion show.** You know what they were doing in the time the movie depicted them broke up? Recording The Works, and touring around the world. It's not even obscure knowledge, anyone with a brain could figure out that's not what happened

The movie had tons of opportunities to tell a great story about Freddie Mercury and Queen, and instead it dropped the ball for lies, garbage, and more lies that even the most oblivious person could point out.
- plus, he and Ryan Gosling had a fun Disney World trip while researching for the proposed film
- GDT needs to get a blank check and set free to produce whatever his mind conjures. His imagination is truly fascinating.
- I still liked Mangold’s version and that also did lead to Logan which I found to be a perfect ending and swan song for Jackman’s time in the role
- This one’s script leaked. So did McQuarrie’s version. Aronofsky’s script was something... it had Logan sit back as Yukio sexually assaulted a woman on a train. There was a Daredevil crossover via Logan teaching Stick in the 80s Then he dies at the end. I do not think it would have been well received.
- Let's be clear though, the problems with the Hobbit were caused by cash grabbing movie executives who ruined the films from the very concept. Peter Jackson did not want it to be 3 films.
- yeah, but I can’t fault PJ for how the films turned out.  He was looking forward to taking a backseat role but with no one else around capable of making it after Del Toro left, he was stuck between a rock and a hard place.  It’s no wonder he hasn’t made a big budget film since
- It would have been incredible and something truly unique if the piece of shit studio let Peter Jackson do what he wanted: The entirety of the Hobbit story in the length of one film, presented in two films: One from the perspective of Bilbo, and one from the perspective of Gandalf.
- I wish the studio would have let GDT completely reimagine The Hobbit because he probably makes the movie closer to the book. The animated version is closer to the book. 

He had a vision of how Smaug should look and studio wasnt really sold on it. He was going to have to stick with the way the hobbits, elves, dwarves, and Gollum looked like in LotR. He worked on it for 2 years before leaving very close to when filming was supposed to begin. I think it was creative differences with the studio but he says he left so he could work on other projects.
- the Ministry of Magic is already a huge mess of overbearing and Big Brother bureaucracy, Gilliam would have had a field day with that
- I just hope we get to see another film with the Abrams (Kelvin?) cast.  It got me into Star Trek and my dad, who’s loved ST all his life loves the mew films the most.  Ironically, Into Darkness is his favorite.  And this is a guy who won tickets to the premiere for First Contact and did shots with Chief O’Brien at the after party
- The problem with statements like "Freddie was queen" is that it dismisses everything the rest of the band contributed to their music. It's very true that Freddie was the image and melodic strength of Queen, but this is why the non-frontmen of a band can get so jealous and insist on some spotlight of their own.
- hehe, “Justin League”
- There were a lot of production problems, and Jackson ran with some stuff from Del Toro, but not a lot. 

Remember as well that Del Toro originally was going to make two movies, not three.

This is what Jackson said:

>“[Guillermo] had designed a lot of the movie in the way he was going to shoot it and I looked at his designs when I ended up taking over, and a lot of his designs are very Guillermo,” Jackson told io9. “Which is great, and that was the whole beauty of him doing it at that stage, it was very much stuff that you would recognize from Pan’s Labyrinth or Hellboy. It was his artistic vision and I couldn’t make that movie. I looked at his designs and I felt the only person that can make a Guillermo Del Toro movie is Guillermo and it shouldn’t be me.”

>And therein lies the problem. Jackson has never directed anyone else’s script.

>”Every film I’m ever made in my life, I’ve been involved in the scriptwriting,” he said. “I just can’t do it. I can’t put my head into somebody else’s idea, I have to generate it from the beginning. **So I redesigned the film pretty much.”**

>But rest assured, Jackson says del Toro’s “DNA” is still in there. “**There was definitely things he did that I thought were cool and I’ve kind of taken bits of pieces of his stuff and altering it and changing it as I saw it. But the film was largely redesigned,” said Jackson.**
- Oh my god I would so watch it!
- There's screenshots/ screen test footage of him in the suit... He's long-haired kinda like in Con-Air. (Probably similar timeframe). There's the famous Kevin Smith Q&A about it, but that actually triggered a whole spin-off documentary about it called "The death of Superman Lives: What happened?".  The Q&A covers the best parts, but if you want more detail, go watch that too...
- I always think it would’ve been great. Given Burton’s style and the long haired Nic Cage casting decision then I’ve always assumed that they intended to lean into the idea of Superman really being an alien / outsider rather than leaning into the Christopher Reeve idea of him representing all American wholesome values. Burton probably wanted to replicate the 180 he did with making camp Batman so dark.

I think especially because we’ve barely seen any of Superman’s rogue gallery on screen as well..then it would’ve been rad for Mars Attacks-era Burton to give us Braniac and co for the first time. 

It’s definitely a weird movie to conceptualise though..quite different to the other superman media we’ve been given
- Apparently George Lucas showing David Lynch concept art of the Ewoks made him physically ill and it’s what made him drop the project lol. (This comes from a David Lynch speech I saw on YouTube a while back)
- Yoda dies but returns as a brain on a tree branch
- And Kyle McLachlan as Jabba the Hutt
- “Hey Luke, daddy wants to fuuuuuuuuuuck"
- I don't hate that.
- Body-horror Vader would have made people sick.
- Leia: “Cut me a little bit right here.” 
Han: “Looks like somebody already beat me to it.” Leia: “I know.”
- [removed]
- HBO's Jurassic Park, based off the book, please.

They could do it after they wrap up Westworld.
- According to reports it was going to be a bunch of flashbacks with Hank Pym as the main character. It seems like not a lot of that original concept made it to theaters.
- If he had just sat on his ass and done it instead of taking one other project after another instead.

He waited until the MCU had grown too much, restricting his creative freedom. But had he not been tardy, he could have been the one to shape the MCU instead.

Feige had Ant Man planned as a central member for the original Avengers movie, and after Wright did one delay after another this fell all apart.
- Feige wouldn't have kept edgar Wright, wright didn't want to be part of a connected universe and that's feiges whole thing.
- Whedon was worth pissing off. His two films don't hold up as well as the other Avenger's outings. Great at the time, but they are not aging as gracefully. Plus all the personal revelations... it was only a matter of time before the house of mouse showed him the door anyway.
- If you haven’t seen it, eXistenZ is David Cronenberg’s PKD movie.
- should have had Cronenberg do the remake.
- This.  Arnie's is one of my favorite action films ever.  And it has the best Arnold line of any movie: "Benny!  Screw you!" and then kills Benny with a giant drill.  You can't top that.

But the remake was awful.  Arnold's was more cerebral than the remake.  Cronenberg's remake would be incredible.  Still different than Arnold's, but in a good way.
- I had to investigate this for myself and found this, LOL.

> Easily the most disturbing element, however, is a scene in which Spider-Man performs a seductive spider-dance for Mary Jane while spouting trivia about the courtship rituals of spiders, before binding her to the Brooklyn Bridge with his webs and making love to her. Perhaps it's for the best that we never saw that on the big screen.


This is such a hilariously bad thing to picture. I simultaneously want this so bad and yet am so grateful it didn’t happen. 

[original article ](https://screenrant.com/spider-man-james-cameron-undermade-marvel-movie-story-details/)
- I could have sworn he also wanted to start the franchise off with him in the black suit.

Doc Ock was the main villain but he didn’t think the technology was at where he wanted it to be. Then he left to make True Lies and begin inventing his own tech to make movies.
- If I remember properly, he webs up MJ in a sexual S&M way, organic webs are alluded to being jizz, puts Flash into a coma, Electro is the Kingpin and his master plan is literally stealing rounded off cents from banks like in Superman 3/Office Space, Sandman is a mute and Peter Parker in general is a really angry dude with almost school shooter personality.

I mean, the angry Peter really isn't that different from the original Ditko comics, but I don't think that would have worked all that well in the current day.
- Maybe relevant: [NSFW - from the porn parody](https://gfycat.com/EquatorialConsiderateCivet)
- An R rated Spider-Man film…there’s no way that would work. Now Batman? Sure, Wolverine? Definitely, but Spider-Man isn’t exactly someone I think screams “let him loose”.

"Uy, don't have the soup."
- “Exorcism?! I thought I was here for a circumcision!”


“Luckily I carry my exorcism tools in the same bag as my circumcision ones.  You never know when you can get a two for one deal these days.”
- Yes. Him doing Discworld would be magical.
- I always forget how good of an actor David Tennant is until I see him again.
- Damn, this just brought back memories of reading Jurassic Park when I was 12, thinking it would be like the movie.

The part that positively traumatized me was Nedry's death. Don't get me wrong, he had it coming, but really? >!Being blinded, then holding his own internal organs and not realizing at first was f'n brutal.!<
- Henry Wu struggling against a dinosaur that's disemboweled and is eating him alive sticks with me.
- For me it’s Hammond slowly but surely succumbing to the compy poison. He just lays down, giving up, feeling peace, as a compy jumps up on him to eat his face.
- And Muldoon. Especially Muldoon.
- Also Needry getting disemboweled, and the velociraptor attack in the beginning was much more graphic, with the worker surviving long enough to get airlifted to a hospital.
- Crichton's characters basically exist to debate whatever the themes of the novel are.
- Yeah Crichton is not good with character development. The only real difference between the characters is their name, age, and occupation.
- Landfall is the shit, Halo 3 had the best marketing campaign in videogame history
- What the FUCK that was Blomkamp?
- Yes! This is exactly what a Halo movie should look like
- Sometimes dead is better
- My thoughts also on George Romero's Resident Evil. The script is available online. It's very weird and it's not very accurate to the games, but it's a way better script than any of the Paul WS Anderson films. Not that it's a high bar to clear, but still, it was sort of interesting.
- That was my problem with the current IT adaptation. There is a lot to like, but since the board at New Line Cinema is lazy and crazy with jump scares, they didn't let it breathe easy. A jump scare should be treated like ascending during a roller coaster lift, and apart from a couple of key moments (the beginning and the film projector sequence) the scares went way too fast. Fukunaga would've made those more intense since he said it was going to be a hair-raising experience and I believe him.

Andy Muschietti is not a bad director, but he could've done far better with IT. I look forward to seeing his take on The Jaunt, if he ever gets around to it.
- Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime 

Imagine how great this would have been
- Couldn’t have hurt any.
- He is really fucking good at sequels.
- I’d love to see the opening with Dr. Levine parachuting onto the island (Lance Henriksen, obviously). Cameron is also really great with models so I’d bet Thorne’s vehicles would’ve looked like LV-426 landing craft
- Cameron doing a more actiion oriented sequel after a more horror oriented first movie? Nope. Can't see it working.
- We got Alien out of it, at least.
- Wes Anderson's Se7en would have been like swallowing your Burning Man stash of hallucinogens all at once.
- Even if the film was still made in his quirky style, imagine seeing a Wes Anderson film with extremely dark subject matter.
- He did an episode of CSI a looong time ago, and it felt like a far cry from his normal style.
- yeah i think with somebody like Tarantino, people forget that he does his style because thats what he likes. Hes an incredible writer and director and probably doesnt need to confine himself to his style.
- Folks don’t realize that Tarantino has directed a lot of television and other minor things, that are nothing like his movies. I think he’d do just fine with Star Trek.
- The Clive Owen bit is new to me. The way I heard it, he was wanting to do Casino Royale with Brosnan since MGM had just gotten the rights to it and Brosnan hadn't departed the franchise yet. He wanted to do it set in the 50s, and played straight instead of campy, much closer in tone to Fleming's novel.
- And the ever famous "can he actually say that" of:

"Cause storing dead Klingons ain't my fucking business."
- Yes, but Kubrick would have been there as producer and co-writer, which would have been incredible.
- And it would have worked so well as a continuation from his decisions in TLJ. Such a shame they got cold feet at Disney.
- Finn had so much potential but they used almost none of it.
- I feel like for the most part, it would’ve been better than what we got, but not without its own faults. I think it included a Rey/Poe romance for one, and that’s arguably even more contrived than Reylo. But at the same time, the lack of Palpatine and a greater focus on Ben as the villain would’ve been cool to see.
- Although to be fair I could smear the contents of my cats litter box on some cardboard and call it a storyboard and it would probably still look better than what we got.
- "Anyone can use the force!"

"No Rey you are Palpatines granddaughter."
- You and I, we’re from the street
- Thor Ragnarok is proof you can self parody and still be great.
- > people were saying Alden Ehrenreich needed an acting coach on set because his performance was like Ace Ventura.

[Would that it were so simple.](https://youtu.be/G629a_3MkkI)
- I believe George Lucas took over supervising the editing (uncredited) on Jurassic Park while Steven was shooting Schindler's List that year.
- That was fucking insane. He also mentioned how emotionally draining it was to have to film such a horrific story all day, then go to his trailer where the edited footage for JP was downloaded for him to approve.
- I really prefer the kids section to the rest of the movie
- Its crazy the sort of shit you could get away with back in the day. Studios hold so much more power now.
- > He always went to bat for the young guys

Interestingly, Coppola isn’t that much older than Scorsese.
- [deleted]
- I'm pretty sure he *had* to go small and gritty, studios weren't giving him much money to work with back then
- Lol it seems like Coppola unwillingly made three or four of the greatest movies ever.
- Very important context.

It wasn’t a senior director vouching for a young gun.  It was a contemporary vouching for a peer.
- Your comment is disgusting yet accurate. Ugh.
- SPR is definitely rated R
- [deleted]
- Yeah saying Jurassic Park was for kids is kind of misleading. That movie was a few palm fronds and foggy windows away from an R rating, but concessions were made because the concept played so well with kids. It’s definitely an action/horror film in its own right. People are just blinded by the effects.
- It seemed like it had traction at one time, sad it stalled out.
- Bring Michael Fassbender back for it too…
- You mean The Thomas Crown Affair?
- Lemme show ya something, *it's the way of the future*
- "A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool?"

"What?"

"Rent. Give me Rent."
- I could turn the daily bugle into my bicycle room.
- You literally made me flashback to watching Sports Night as a kid.
- Yes, there would absolutely be a crawl-and-talk
- Howard Stark, in the main foyer of Stark Tower, had an enormous block of cheese…
- What’s wrong with the 2003 hulk?
- >Which made sense, too, since they wanted to distance it from the 2003 Hulk




All 484 of Ang Lee Hulk fans are confused by that statement
- Even the 1989 Batman, which was really the first Batman movie I had seen as a kid (they did reruns of Adam West occasionally on YTV), there is no origin story.  It opens with Batman already being an established vigilante.  Sure there are a couple little flashbacks and exposition, but it doesn't spend 2/3rds of the movie on him learning to be Batman.
- [deleted]
- Watched that for the first time just a couple of nights ago. Enjoyed it a lot, and came out with much respect for Elton, both for how he turned his life around and how he let the movie show exactly how much of an asshole he was before getting clean. It really made the whole Marshall Mathers AA sponsor thing make way more sense.
- I love that Dexter Fletcher was called in to finish production on Bohemian Rhapsody, and then he made Rocketman which basically got everything right that Bohemian Rhapsody got wrong
- I like how Rocketman is such a coherent story, that weaves the different details together, so that it fits, where BR just is a jumbled mess that does not work in any way, apart from the shot-for-shot remake of the Live-Aid performance.
- Same. I hear Rami Malek did a good job and I appreciate the casting choice, but even the trailers just look really watered down from what we were anticipating back when Sacha Baron Cohen was involved.
- Bohemian Rhapsody was the most cookie-cutter version of that story that exists. It was so by-the-numbers it felt like a teen rock magazine article put to screen.
- I admit the following is a bit of a Reddit circlejerk opinion, but… Walk Hard murdered the music biopic. It makes no sense to write one anymore as Dewey Cox basically encompasses every cliche.
- No, none of the blokes involved with a popular rock band in the 70s and 80s would ever touch drugs, drink heavily, or shag groupies.

Even the thought of it would disgust them.
- "Sorry Freddy, I can't stay at your party where there's \*gasp\* beer cans and cigarettes.  I HAVE TO GET HOME TO MY WIFE AND KIDS."
- the best thing i've heard is that Roger Taylors ex-wife was at one point portrayed in the movie, she didn't like how she was portrayed, and was just cut out entirely. the care and consideration to all people still actually alive in the move, is amazing, considering how every person in the movie who isn't dead is just thrown under the bus (not saying that Paul Prenter was a good lad) but the only people who did not come off as squeaky clean were coincidentally not around to object to the way they were portrayed.
- Omg I wanted to throw up in the middle of the theater during those scenes where the rest of Queen goes home early from the party right to their wives for a nice, quiet evening.
- The Wolverine movies only went up. They just got better dramatically.
- Logan is on my list of movies I can’t watch again.  Watched it once, it was great, but man can I not put myself through that again.  Combined with the whole element of Wolverine taking care of the Professor, and me having to I take care of my dying dad who was a shell of himself because of an illness - oh boy oh boy was I balling through the whole film.
- Aronofsky saw too many Japanese pornos.
- He wanted a two part Hobbit, and the third movie was said to be almost a documentary style worldbuilding film set in the 60 or so years between the Hobbit and LOTR
- Technically it was PJ who suggested the third film in order to buy them time to complete some form of an ending and he knew WB would bite because it would mean another theatrical release that would make them more money. They found as they were coming to the end of finishing the second movie that BOFA had a rushed and cold ending.

PJ says it in BOTFA’s appendices.
- I'm getting tired of Warner Bros ruining good franchises. There I said it.
- I got the sense Peter jackson wanted to see del tori's hobbit too
- "I was winging it"

"I didn't know what the hell I was doing"
- He was so exhausted halfway through the third Hobbit film that Andy Serkis took over for like a week so that he could get his legs back under him.
- That actually sounds really fucking interesting
- That sounds awesome, actually. But the studio wanted *Lord of the Rings 2.0*, sadly.
- There is a documentary that was made during the filming of the Hobbit, it's practically a showcase of Jackson's descent into madness. He was staying up all night rewriting the script then shooting the next day.
- As long as this somehow prevented Burton from getting on the train of predictable choices he's been on. I wouldn't want Helena Bonham Carter as Wonder Woman or Jonny Depp as Aquaman.
- "But then, all of a sudden, like, a giant fuckin' spider shows up."

- Oh my God. The thought of some kind of organic/mechanical nightmare Vader shambling across the screen that devours the Emperor at the end using acid vomit is pretty fucking amazing.
- As much as I love the character of Harry, Michael Ontkean is not a good actor and Forster did a better job of being the soft spoken, affable, sheriff, that complements Cooper perfectly.
- Whoa, this sounds like an amazing idea! And perfect to go along with Westworld being originally a Crichton story.
- i’m not sure if that would’ve been better than what we have now. i think Ant Man being more of a side kick fugitive works well for Paul Rudd’s version.
- ~~If that's true, idk wtf Wright was thinking would happen. The shared universe was already very clearly in place~~. 

I say this as a fan of Wright; no hate.

Edit: Thanks u/PostProductionPro. I didn't realise Wright's Ant-Man script was written around 2008, way before the success of Iron Man and possibility of a shared universe.
- I don't miss Whedon at all.  I do hope the Russos return for more at some point. They completely got it. I think Winter Soldier (along with Guardians Vol 1) was the first glimpse at what was possible when suits got out of the way and let the filmmakers do their thing.

I would love to see Edgar Wright try again with Marvel now that things are much better creatively, maybe with an Excalibur or Captain Britain adaptation.

- I am genuinely surprised that I had never thought of something like this even existing.
- James Mangold, director of Wolverine/Logan, described the benefits of R-Rated films well that goes beyond just 'lots of sex and F-bombs' that may not be immediately obvious:

> "When you make a rated R film, the film is no longer marketed to nine-year-olds. And when the film is no longer marketed to nine or 10 year old kids, there's other changes that happen behind the scenes. The studio no longer anticipates that the film will play for families. Because the studio no longer anticipates the film will play as a family film, there are narrative burdens that are no longer upon the movie that are far different than just whether there's language or sexuality or violence."

>"They also relate to the reading level of the movie, which can go up. The scene lengths can be longer. The pauses can be greater. The themes can be more complex and adult, because you are no longer servicing. You're not making a Happy Meal anymore. You're making a grownup meal, and that changes everything."

>"My respect for what comic books I grew up with was that they always resonated. Part of what was attractive to me about it as a young man was that they weren't childish. They resonated with themes of romance, sexuality, revenge, grief, haunted childhoods, psychological damage. All these ideas were really interesting and they were more complicated in the comic books than they were, and that was part of the attraction of them. There was stuff that there's going on that wasn't in children's television or in our cartoons. There was something racy going on, in the same way that even when you watch a Bugs Bunny cartoon now, you realize... The reason I love them so much is there was something racy going on in those."

"Sorry kid, I'm a rabbi, but if you'd like I'll call my brother. He's a lawyer."
- “Damien Karras? Feh! I remember when his papa was still called Herschel Kohen and working as a mohel just for tips!”
- How dare you put such a beautiful idea in my head, knowing it can never be real?
- You forget how good the best actors are because it doesn't feel like they're acting.
- I read it around the same age and love it, didn't like the movie because it deviated the book too much.

What was cool about the book was the deaths were so poetic. Hammond, who unlike the movie was a selfish conman who sought attention dies unceremoniously while still blaming others for his mistakes.
- And thinking "Oh no, I shouldn't let my intestines spill out and touch the ground! That's not sanitary!" as he dies.
- That was my reaction as well, then when I rewatched for the first time in 15 years it’s very obviously him.
- So long as it’s not “The directors wife is the main character and outshines all the resident evil characters we gave a shit about”
- Yup. Plus it has an evil corporation and para-militaristic elements, both are common in Cameron's films.
- A Midsommar type of horror film made by him would be amazing.

Also, its crazy how much Owen Wilson looks like Bill Murray in Loki.
- It's also routinely listed as one of the best episodes of CSI ever
- He also directed an episode of ER (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0568048/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_15)
- IS THERE A SIGN OUTSIDE MY HOUSE THAT SAYS DEAD KLINGON STORAGE?
- - Force Awakens: Finn gets out, but just wanted to keep running. His injury at the hands of Kylo Ren kept him from doing so. 

- Last Jedi: Finn still wants to run but thanks to Rose, sees how even the smallest part of the universe can be molded into something bigger and that he has the chance to be a part of that. 

- Duel of the Fates: It all comes full circle and Finn sets other Stormtroopers on his same path,  fulfilling a destiny that was always his.
- I liked TFA way more than most and a lot of that was because of Finn. The Finn we got in that movie is only character since the OT that felt like it was directly inspired by an OT character.
- I wish we could’ve seen what would’ve come from that script. Since it was a first draft hopefully the Rey/Poe thing would’ve gotten removed. I really wish we could’ve seen Adam Driver as full evil Kylo and a fight with Rey using a double bladed lightsaber. It seemed so obvious from the first time we saw her fight in TFA  that they were setting her up for some sort of staff like saber and I couldn’t believe that they never had her fight with one.
- I grew up on A street. But not THE streets.
- I did too, the set design during that part of the movie was incredible, and it's also an interesting gangster story that we haven't really seen before. The adult part is much more in line with its contemporaries and while it's very good it's nothing new.
- You’re not the first person I know to say that. I have found that I like different parts depending on my mood. One time I remember getting all emotional at the end. The movie was really like a Greek tragedy, which probably explains it’s appeal to so many people.
- And that's why nowadays we don't have larger than life actors or directors anymore
- If we're doing this can I nominate Wes Chatham (Amos, 'The Expanse') for the role of Doomguy?
- Well at least the soundtrack would be tight. Symphonic knee deep in the dead?
- Isn't there a scene where you can see a guy's intestines? 100% R rated.
- Temple of Doom was the reason there’s a PG-13 rating.  It was rated PG,  but the scene where they’re eating monkey brains and another where a guy’s still beating heart is pulled out of his chest we’re deemed too gory for kids and thus PG-13 was born. 
Hey, at least they didn’t show any tits, or it would have been R right away. 🙄
- He's definitely softened over the last 2 decades.  The only really gritty thing hes done somewhat recently was Munich and that was 16 years ago.  However, I have no idea why someone would think hes incapable of doing dark and gritty.
- I was actually going for West Wing but Sports Night works just as well. In West Wing Spidey has a manilla folder as he crawls along the walls, in Sports Night he carries a clipboard as he dangles from studio lighting.
- Hey that's me
- But it did create an origin story for the Joker. He starts off as a petty criminal then becomes a gangster and falls into the vat of chemicals after an encounter with Batman. Becomes the Joker and kills the mob boss he worked for who tried to have him killed.
- I remember when Elton sang the Dido part of Stan at the Grammys. That was HUGE at the time. Eminem was under a lot of scrutiny at the time for his lyrics. Em is on stage alone singing Stan and then one of the biggest gay icons in the world appears out of nowhere and sings along side him and then they share a hug after the song had finished. I didn't know till years later that Elton had been a huge help when Marshal was going through drug addiction and rehab, and that he had been known to connect with other celebrities going through the same thing.
- It’s also the closest any music biopic has come to not being Walk Hard (But Worse).
- Is it _exactly_ how much though? He was very involved in it (credited as a producer I think?). I'm not saying we should expect every bad thing Elton may have done while intoxicated, but I definitely got the impression he turned the volume down on it.
- But then, annoyingly, Rocketman received little of the awards praise Bohemian Rhapsody did
- Dexter fletcher will always be press gang.
- Dexter Fletcher is such a made up sounding name
- Rocketman is very good. Plays like a musical but feels like a biopic.
- I fell in love with Rocketman straight away, it's transition between scenes via song was on point to cover so much in such a small time frame and they nailed it.

Also I think a major bit people overlook is having Taron sing didn't break that 4th wall. 

I kept being pulled out of the scene when the singing came on for BR and couldn't place it till I watched Rocketman.
- Rocketman doesn't pretend to be a source of historical information about when songs were written or came out, it's goal is to tell the story of Eltons life through a musical.

Bohemian Rhapsody on the other hand just comes across as trying to portray events that happened in a typical biopic format but gets very obvious things wrong like styles, or even the decade songs came out.
- Queen to the producer in the movie: Fuck your formulas



Queen to the producer of the movie: we like formulas
- I watched it by myself on an overseas flight and I had nobody to rant to. It was upsetting.
- i only enjoyed the Live-Aid sequence, the actual recreation of the concert, not all the fluff around it.
- It was a fucking travesty of a movie from start to finish. 

The self absorbed fragile twats that consist of ‘Queen’ today completely left out SO MUCH shit and put a fuckload of false garbage that didnt happen in BR.

All in the name of thier ‘image’.

New flash you weapons grade dumbfucks-NOBODY, and i mean NOBODY expects any rock band in the history of EVER to be fucking church going choir boys. 

We want the raw truth. We want to see all the cringeworthy drug and booze fueled insane fuckery you twisted bastards dreamed up and paid for.

You robbed us of those truthful, jaw dropping moments from one of the most creative minds in history in Mercury, you pathetic, whiny snizzes. Fuck off every last one of you. You’re all a damn disgrace to Rock History.
- If I recall correctly it was made in a way for it to more seamlessly be able to cut out homosexuality for a Chinese release. I think it was a big criticism at the time.
- It’s impossible to take  any musician going through struggle seriously after seeing the true difficulties Dewey Cox went through being smell blind.
- Dewey’s brother did have a particularly bad case of being cut in half by a machete.
- > or shag groupies.

Especially not underage groupies.
- The movie was bollocks. Yes, he made a good Mercury, but holy shit, it was like watching a version of Easy Rider without the drugs.
- That opening montage with Wolverine and Sabretooth was amazing though
- Oh my God my blood pressure just rose. Imagine PJ having carte blanche to literally just flesh out the world. I would’ve loved to see the slow descent into darkness in Middle-Earth, while the Hobbits occasionally hear stories but do their own thing.
- What's BOFA?
- Yeah I think he literally said he didn't want to do it but no one else respectable was given the opportunity and the films were going to get made for $$$ anyway.
- Exactly. That's what happens when you have dumb cunts as bosses. You do the best with that little you are given.
- Those movies became the One Ring lol.
- Hahahahahaha Johnny Depp as Aquaman 🤣🤣🤣
- I don’t know. I mean, you’re not wrong but now I’m imagining a Jack Sparrow type aqua man and this car wreck is becoming something I’m having a harder time turning away from.
- Wild wild west
- Sean Penn as Superman, you know, because he’s got the eyes of a stone cold killer. Makes sense, right? We get Superman because we’re from the streets. 

Then Superman hides behind a rock.
- What I wouldn't give to see Lynch get *incredibly* pissed at George Lucas. That would be hilarious. Why would you even think of having them work together lol
- Also watching movies on phones and being concerned about the length of a scene.

https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0

https://youtu.be/80eMhhWnWbk
- Had Cronenberg directed ROTJ, I'd like to think he would've done what TROS eventually did with Palpatine with the decayed corpse on a crane, but 10X more creepy body horror
- I agree. Paul Rudd shines in the smaller roles where he can play a bit more of the normal guy. An Edgar Wright version would have been really cool, but I do like where Rudd's Ant Man landed. Rudd and Wright together could make a great movie though, would love to see that some day.
- He started writing before it was, it just took so long marvels plans changed.
- I'm certain the directors add some unique spin to some scenes, but I would never saw they are director driven projects or that the suits aren't involved, they are heavily. A lot of the work on them is done years in advance of the director. The entire movie, even non-CGI scenes are pre-vised, and if you view them side by side with the final clip, even the camera angles and framing are similar.  These are films by committee if I ever saw them.
- > I think Winter Soldier (along with Guardians Vol 1) was the first glimpse at what was possible when suits got out of the way and let the filmmakers do their thing.

I would argue Iron Man 1 was, but that was also before they saw the actual massive franchise potential
- I don't need to click that to know what it is
- It is weird from a story telling point of view. You need to get to know regular Peter and Spider-Man before you can then alter him the way the black suit did. And of course don't make him dance...
- Ditko Spidey wasn’t a potential school shooter, he was just prickly. He wanted to stick it to his bullies by getting rich and successful, not by killing them.
- I always found it amusing that Adrian Grenier was the absolute worst actor on the show. And also not particularly “hot.” Not an ugly dude, but I found it really hard to buy him as a Hollywood leading-man-hunk. The rest of the cast is fucking perfect.
- “Hey, Lucifer, it’s me Rabbi Tuckman.  Remember we used pound Manischewitz‘s together before Jackie Mason concerts???”

Lucifer: “Oh God, not this guy again…”
- You're right. It helps that Tennant and Sheen are good friends in real life, but both of them just disappear and their characters take their place.
- Don't get me wrong, I loved the book too! The first thing I did when I finished it was ask my mother to take me to the library to buy The Lost World. The deaths were brutal, but hey, if they make a mark to the point I can quote that scene after a long time, I think it did work!

But I think that the movie does it justice. I honestly can appreciate it deviating from its source material. Some of my all time favorite movies are quite different from what inspired them: Christine, The Shining and Jurassic Park itself. I just don't think we can judge them based on their sources, it's just two different mediums. That's what the Harry Potter series got so wrong imo. They tried to smash everything that was in the books in the movies, and the result was that the later ones were incoherent messes.
- Hammond eaten by the compys is amazing and poetic  In the novel compmys eat the shit of the other dinosaurs.  In the book Hammond is a piece of shit.
- [reminds me of this SNL sketch](https://youtu.be/gfDIAZCwHQE)
- Honestly, The Lighthouse seems like a film he'd make if he wanted to make horror.
- Thank you. All of his films have some pretty dark subject matter. I cry my ass off every time Ned dies in Life Aquatic, and I can’t say I’ve ever cried watching a Scorsese or Tarantino movie.
- Literally was wondering wtf these people are talking about, the thematic material of Anderson is dark, it's their exposition that isn't so much
- It's the only episode where I remember the stuff that happened on it. And yes, easily the best episode for me.
- Agreed. Honestly, bringing back Anakin/Luke’s lightsaber was a mistake. If anything, they could’ve had Rey combine two lightsabers (maybe Luke’s green one and Leia’s blue one) into a staff / double-bladed lightsaber. It would’ve really stood out on its own.

It’s crazy that JJ didn’t give Rey a double-bladed lightsaber when TFA was his movie; Rey having a staff was his idea! Evil Rey in episode 9 even had one. But alas, maybe the books / comics / shows will reveal that Rey’s yellow one actually does have two sides. Only time will tell.
- Really, a Beetlejuice sequel?  Didn't we say everything we needed to say with the first one?  Must we go tropical?
- A24 is doing cool shit
- Yeah while he lies there crying for his mother

There is also the scene where a knife is slowly forced into a guys chest and you can hear the crunch of it punching through
- There are quite a few movies that are pg-13 that have nudity, hell there are pg movies that have full frontal nudity
- That scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark where the Nazis get melted gave me nightmares as a kid.
- Let Spidey be Spidey.
- I'm a guy who wants to know if Marvel can make a movie now post-Universal rights.
- Yes, they also made him the guy who killed Bruce's parents.  Batman was also pretty loose with the 'no killing' thing in the Burton films too
- His biography is absolutely fantastic and has really great insights about other celebrities Elton met over the year (Elvis, Michael Jackson, The Queen Mother, Princess Diana). The only thing he doesn't really go in to detail about is his marriage to Renate Blauel, because he had promised when they divorced not to reveal any sordid details about their marriage.
- I believe Elton was Em's NA sponsor as well.
- I remember seeing that live. Definitely a big moment.
- Walk Hard is 10/10 satire and one of my all time favorite comedies
- It's a mainstream movie at the end of the day. There only so much you can show before you turn away a majority of the audience.
- His autobiography audiobook is read by taron egerton amd goes into more depth iirc
- Because Elton John is still alive.
- This, I will always remember that show for Fletcher and my huge crush on Julia Sawhala.
- Dexter Fletcher knows that guns are for show, and knives for a pro *because* of Press Gang.


Edit: nothing to see here
- exactly why i enjoy it a lot, it knows it needs to take liberties in terms of story, but still manages to weave enough "real" stuff into a web of fantasies, it does not feel the need to protect any egos, it's just a story, and it feels very authentic as a result.
- Considering its subject matter lived (lives?) a very flamboyant, larger-than-life life I felt the musical nature of it compared to the rote biopic formula worked very much in its favor and made a lot of sense. Arguably truer to life for who Elton John was/is.
- Sometimes we all have trouble seeing ourselves for who we truly are.
- I'm picturing you mashing the little ding ding ding flight attendant button, and a cabin crew member turning up to say "for the last time just turn the movie off"
- Don't forget about his struggles needing more blankets and less blankets.
- "The wrong kid died!"
- And he never paid for drugs!
- This is the worst case of a person being sawed in half that I have ever seen.

Give it to us straight doc, we ain't scientists!
- Was that where they’re shown fighting in various wars throughout different centuries? I honestly could have watched a movie just about that
- BOFA DEEZ NUTS
- It absolutely was. If you see those behind the scene docs (I’m sure there’s some on YouTube), you can see Peter Jackson’s slow descent into madness that led to his meltdown which led to Serkis taking over temporarily.
- That’s *Captain* Aquaman
- So many golden quotes from that story. "In Hollywood you fail up"
- Idk if I could see them working together, but I could honestly see Lynch being a good fit for Star Wars. I'm a firm believer that the total bizareness of the universe was a crucial part of the original's success, and that's something Lynch does really well. The risky part would be Lynch's ability to make it family-friendly.
- Sometimes conflict like that can lead to greatness. 

One of the great NBA coaches of all time, phil jackson, liked to slightly pit his stars against each other, as he believed them working through it and compromising would lift them higher, and you can't deny his success. 

And most people would agree that Lucas needs a little push back for his ideas.
- George Lucas’s uncaring low energy voice arguing with David Lynch’s pure angry old man would be a site to behold
- I love that man
- GET REAL
- Makes sense. Online says Wright wrote Ant-Man around 2008, which I believe precedes any plans of a shared universe.

Edited my original comment. Thanks for clearing that up, buddy.
- While you may be correct, a director's style certainly adds a lot to the movie. My specific example would be the difference between Kenneth Branagh's Thor and Taika Waititi's Thor Ragnarok.
- I don’t think the symbiote factors in at all
- It’s hard finding someone who can pull off A lister because they’d probably be an A lister
- He definitely has that pretty boy look and they even made a point in one episode to talk about how his body type isn't really in line with huge blockbuster leading men, but you're right, he was a weird choice to lead the show. He definitely didn't come off as charismatic as the show wants you to believe he is imo.
- They are and they made 2 seasons of an amazing comedy series together called staged. Its fucking hilarious
- I like this interpretation. In the movie the dinosaurs were the bad guys. In the book, the people were.
- Just... do the Young Jedi Academy saga. It was so easy. Even if they’re not siblings, maybe lovers or something, Rey v Kylo as Jacen and Jaina would have been great. It would end in a genderswapped version of the game of thrones conclusion
- Banger after banger. Family member worked on The Florida Project and confirmed my initial suspicions about having to film the end scene in the park guerrilla style because they didn't get permission to film. They have consistently put out quality work time and time again.

[https://i.imgur.com/A220swm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/A220swm.jpg)
- I can't finish the battle of Rommel anymore because of that fucking scene.  Some point over the past 10 years a lot of the old war movies i liked to watch turned from 'hehehe cool' to 'man, just no' to me.
- The part where a guy takes his helmet off after it deflected a bullet only to get shot was the scene that stayed with me. He was in such awe that it saved his life and he removed it.
- They really should. Hulk deserves a movie now after being a sidekick for every Avengers movie.
- Universal still has distribution rights, so we're unlikely to see a standalone movie.  However, from my understanding, they could do a standalone Disney+ series like they are with Hawkeye since I believe those rights only apply to movies.
- God that scene in the movie when Bruce Wayne puts it together is so amazing and well done.
- And the audiobook is narrated by Taron Edgerton!
- It was one of those situations where a celebrity needed another celebrity. Apparently his previous sponsors who were just randos just fanboyed instead of actually helping him.
- He also gifted Elton and his partner with Diamond studded cock rings for their wedding, which is beyond amazing.
- No, he should've showed it. He should've showed alllll of it. Full penetration.
- side note, I thought Elton John was fucking hilarious in Kingsmen 2.  Plus, he and Taron seem like pals.  And Taron is also a good singer in his own right
- still the most realistic portrayal of withdrawal in film.
- Nurse: He needs both less blankets AND more blankets!

Doctor: There's nothing more we can do...
- Not. Once.
- You don't want no part of that Dewey
- That was crazy good. If I had been making Wolverine, and that happened to be the first thing we made, the sequence of Logan and Victor shredding in every war since my granddad was in diapers? I would've said "Is anyone else liking this? Yeah? I'm changing the whole shit!"

I wonder how I would've recast Ryan Reynolds
- Especially if the topic is teddy bears with spears.
- Yeah I appreciate that they wanted someone relatively unknown (good idea) so that we could see them just as Vinny Chase and not Ryan Phillipe or whatever. But considering how many hunky actors are in LA looking for roles, I figure there just have been someone with better chops than Grenier. He really was not great.
- And his acting in the movies within the show is shit. They do bring this up at one point because I think his friends know he can’t act well. But the public is supposed to believe he’s incredible.
- Makes you think about the recruiting age of the military, huh?
- They kinda gloss over the "professor hulk" thing in endgame, maybe that story?
- Is that the part in his apartment with the fire poker? Its been a while but I love that seen... Goes from calm and collected to " you wanna get nuts?! Let's get nuts!! "
- That guy was born to play as Elton. Plus he's got an amazing voice!
- I mean that makes sense. There are stresses to being a celeb that we just won’t understand
- Apparently Taron singing an Elton John song in Sing (can't remember which one) was a large part of the reason he was cast in Rocketman
- I kind of think I do.
- Are you kidding? *I am Queens Boulevard.*
- Can't believe he didn't get an Oscar nom for it.
- The lead up to that Oscar ceremony was the best because of Rocketman. Elton was performing at some preparty and brought Taron on stage and hadn't really heard him sing yet. I think it was Rocketman they were singing and Elton handed the song off to Taron and it blew his mind. John didn't realize that Edgerton took lessons to sing like him.
- It's true. I'm very stressed and no one's heard of me
- I'm still standing is the song.
- He even won the golden globe for his performance. It’s bizarre to have a golden globe winner not even be nominated for the Oscar equivalent… especially considering that Rami Malek won the best acting Oscar a year before playing a similar role. To be honest, I think Taron did an equal, if not better performance in Rocketman.

==================================================
Post Title: Classic movies should get re-released in theaters more often.
Author: Spirited_Respect_578
Score: 35829
Content:
Classic movies like Jurassic Park or Star Wars should get released in theaters more often, it would bring back memories for those people who saw those movies in their original run, and it would offer a new experience for those who only saw them on TV. 

And I also think if those movies were given a full run in theaters Luke a regular movie, a theater re-release could be financially successful as well. 

Plus, let's be honest, who wouldn't want to see a movie like Jaws or Terminator 2 in theaters?

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- Gotta keep your eye on AMC fathom events. They do this all the time, but no one is going to spend millions on an advertising campaign
- you should check to see if there is a smaller independent cinema near you, there is one in my closest city that used to show older movies all the time
- Some theaters are! I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark two weeks ago in an AMC in my city, but they’re usually weekday matinees.
- The best movie experience I had in years was an Alien+Aliens double feature at Alamo two years back.
- I saw the original jurassic Park for the first time on the big screen last summer at a drive in and it was a fantastic experience, I'd love if theaters played older movies like that again
- When the local IMAX theatre was struggling to stay afloat, it started doing screenings of older movies and it was great!
 
This was back when theatre seating was trash, so you got the excellent IMAX seating. No one cared that the movie didn't fill the whole screen. A+
 
Top Gun hits different when it's not on your family's 20-something-inch television.
- I would like to see some epics in cinema.Like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Seven Samurai".I think it would be amazing expirience.
- The Alamo Drafthouse does this a lot (special showings of cool older movies, topical or holiday-specific movies, etc). A lot of the smaller local movie houses do this, if you're lucky enough to have one in your city, definitely check out their calendar for special releases!
- Never got to see LOTR in theaters. Would love to have the opportunity to see the Trilogy on the big screen
- I agree! I really want to see some older movies in 4K rendition
- Give me Interstellar in IMAX again
- Fathom Events is what you want.
- Cineplex does that here in Canada called the Flashback Film Series. Or did, prior to COVID shutting down everything. You can request from a bunch of different classics and they’ll run them in cinemas for about a week. Right now Mad Max: Fury Road is screening in select cinemas (including the Black & Chrome edition). Plus it’s cheap!

They also did the Flashback Film Festival on an annual basis where for a solid week straight they’d play only classics in their popular cinemas. Here’s hoping they do it again this year. I love when they screen these as it gives another chance to watch great movies on the big screen.
- Seeing Casablanca on the big screen was amazing.
- I would pay good money to watch Terminator 2 in a theater.
- I think there will be a massive campaign to get people back in theatres and a majority of that will be the classics.
- Counter-point: re-releases do not get people in the seats. This has been done over and over, so it is not like there is no empirical evidence. The pros for the theaters are that the licensing for re-run films is much lower than a new release, so they get more of the box office. The cons are that the box offices are going to pretty small. The best showings are the ones that are well marketed as sort of an event screening, like Rocky Horror Picture Show, midnight screenings of cult classics, etc. But those are one-off screenings. 

The theater I worked for did both Jaws and Terminator 2 as midnight screenings *at least* a couple times. They did, at best, okay.
-  Classic films are being shown quite often in the UK, mainly in Vue cinemas and in the Odeon.
- >Classic movies like Jurassic Park or Star Wars

♪I'm so ooooooooooold♪

I was thinking Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Stormy Weather. Not movies that came out when I was 14 ;)
- There's an "International" Film Festival yearly in my hometown (Ghent, Belgium) and every year they program at least a couple of classics. I always try to go if any of my favorites pass by.

Last year it was even a bit more special. Solaris (1972), but with a new (played live-ish by the producer) experimental electronic music score.
Had a great night.

EDIT: I remember seeing Vertigo by Hitchcock a couple of years back.
- This was pretty much 2020.  You could even rent a private showing of about any classic film for $100 and have up to twenty people attend socially distant with you.  I knew a group that did Back to the Future.
- I really wish I could've made it to a theater when they re-released Wrath of Khan a few years back, but the nearest showing was too far.
- The classics sometimes make the rounds. A few years ago "2001: A Space Odyssey" was on tour. Wow, what an amazing film on the big screen. That was a few years ago here in the Bay Area when Century 21 in San Jose was still open. The screen was the curved Cinerama style.

I also saw the Nolan-ized version of "2001" on IMAX in Saratoga; that was amazing as well. 

I saw "Terminator 2" in Huntsville, Alabama when it came out and let's just say that that was the most fun I've had watching a movie ever. I believe 99% of the patrons were marines and soldiers from Redstone Arsenal, as was I. We were all drinking and throwing popcorn during the film. The one part that sticks with me is when the T-1000 walks "through" the prison door by melding into the metal. The silence was broken by a collective "Holy mother of god!" hoot and holler at what we had just witnessed. 

I miss those movie magic days.
- Bring back **TOMBSTONE.**
- TLDR; i agree, but it's not financially realistic.   
it's not very common because most of the sales come from the hype leading up to the release. the theaters also have to basically lease the reels from the film companies in most cases and so they aren't allowed to play them after the predetermined window. you have to buy or lease the rights to those old movies in order to screen them at a theater too, and usually the ones that end up affordable aren't too far off from what's on TV or a streaming service. basically, there is a very narrow market for this and so the theaters i know of that actually play a lineup of the movies they like are a passion project by a local millionaire and/or a govt funded thing specifically to increase tourism or raise property values. movie theaters are actually not all that profitable or reliable themselves which is why they have to sell you so much price gouged stuff on the side, and people constantly sneak themselves or snacks into the theater to the point that it's more disruptive and costly to try to stop them than it is to let them in in a lot of cases. it would probably do good things for the film industry if there was more of a competition to release the best overall product vs the one that cheaply tailors itself to the times or builds the most hype, but right now streaming services are showing us that the latter is more profitable.
- There was a theater "near" my house that had two old movies for the price of one new release.
- Cinemark has been doing this for the past few years, and I absolutely fucking love. Finally got to see the original trilogy of Star Wars on the big screen. Just saw Tremors the other week. Got to see a special edition trilogy run of Back to the Future all at once a few years go.
- if you go to the right theaters it's pretty common. my local chain does it all the time.
- This year I have seen The Empire Strikes Back and all three LoTR films in the local Vue cinema (UK). It's been amazing to (re)experience such familiar films in the way they were intended to be viewed. Top Gun is on this weekend and I'll hopefully be going to see that too.
- I'm still upset I never got to see Dredd in 3D.
- Locally owned, independent theaters do this often.
- I'd love Dredd to get a second shot in theatres, I'd want Big Trouble In Little China in the cinema too.
- You have an interesting definition of "classic."
- They toured the Blu-Ray print of Jaws for a little bit a few years back. It was awesome.
- There are so many films I'd love to see in the cinemas
Especially cult classics rather then the mainstream collections.
- I would love this but I also need a place to find them. Like a single website that specifically shows all re-releases.

The problem is I literally have no idea how to find out about classic re-releases at my theaters, besides constantly watching the movie listings, and I'm not going to do that in HOPE that a classic release shows up at one of the theaters. They have to advertise currently, and that's hard as hell to pull off.
- They should re release Goldfinger before the new bond. It would fucking insane. But could also make the new one feel like shit if it’s not top drawer.
- I got to watch To Kill a Mockingbird in the theater a couple of years ago. Goddamn, I love that movie.
- Dude I wouldn't stop there, go way back to movies from the 40s, 50s and 60s
I would love to see some of the old hammer horror movies in a seedy old school cinema
- Just saw "My Fair Lady" last Sunday.  Only three people in the viewing.  It was a Fathom event.  Hope more people go see these movies so Fathom keeps doing its thing.  It was also in a large theater,.  I went to see 2001 and it was on the smallest screen.  A Wednesday night where they could have easily put it on one of the larger screens since practically no one was watching what ever was on the bigger screen anyway.
- Absolutely agreeed, since the cinemas reopened I’ve been to 5 films and all of them have been older movies Taxi Driver, Gladiator and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s great seeing favourite movies on the big screen really takes them to the next level, especially stuff like The Lord of the Rings.

Would love to see Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, Mad Max: Fury Road or 2001: A Space Odyssey on the big screen.
- In Austin there is an old theater with velvet curtains and all that will play old movies.  I took m wife to see Ben-Hur (1959) there as she had never seen it.  There was a professor from UT there to talk about the book and the history of the film before it started.  Then we were treated to the full movie, overture and intermission, everything.  I was in heaven.
- I agree. I've seen North By Northwest many times but there's not anything like seeing it on the big screen.
- I grew up watching Jaws on TV my whole life and always loved it. But two years ago I saw it in theaters (it was a midnight show during the summer, so it felt extra special) and WOW it was like I was watching it for the first time. Especially all the ocean shots, I cant explain it but they just hit differently than all those years of watching on tv.
- At an AMC theater!
- Hollywood literally can't make original content anymore unless it's a sequel or spin off, might as well just rerelease shit that's already worked
- The theatre by campus in college did Sunday afternoon throwbacks. I saw the original Jurassic park there and it was life changing
- I’ve been trying to see Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival in theaters because I missed out on them
- Here in Ontario, I was able to see the following films on re-release during Covid : 

JAWS, Jurassic Park, Beetlejuice, The Empire Strikes Back, Nightmare Before Christmas, The Exorcist, Halloween (1978), and Indiana Jones : And The Last Crusade. 

It was the best time ever.
- I watched smokey and the bandit in theatres a few year back. Place was packed. Everyone laughed at all the jokes and I drank 2 Coors tallboys in the theatre. 10/10 would see again
- Unfortunately all we get are comic book nonsense and fast furry balls claptrap.
- I would love to see apocalypse now redux in the theaters!
- Honestly, I feel the only reason the film theater is even still around is just because people want the sort of social experience of going out with their friends and seeing a film. But with newer films everyone's gotta shut the fuck up because they're seeing it for the first time and don't want any details interrupted.

Older films wouldn't matter as much. If you miss anything you can rewatch it at home that same night. Just pop in the DVD or find it on whatever streaming sites have it and check the scenes you were confused on or watch the whole thing.
- For the story : there was a french movie called "le graphique de boscop" released in 1976 and it was in a theater in Lyon every week at midnight until 2010...
- When I studied film in university, the local theatre would place a classic film on the last Friday of the month at midnight. So I got to see Alien, A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, and a few others there. It was a really awesome experience
- I saw The Shining at the cinema two years ago. Amazing experience. I’d happily pay to see remastered releases
- You'll never see Avatar in theater resolution, on the home screen.
- How many more reddit threads about this exact topic will I see before I die?
- I have a drive-in movie theater near my town that was playing a few classics a couple months ago when movies weren’t being released. Jurassic Park was actually one of them. Pretty annoying that they stopped.
- Try looking up local independent theatres. We have a few in my city of around 600k people.
- I have no idea what they will do once the current lockdown ends, but before COVID closed everything Cineplex Theatres in Canada did show classics every month under their Flashback Film series. A few years ago I was able to watch the original Halloween and Hitchcock's Psycho on the same night.
- I took my friend to a show playing "breakfast at Tiffany's" she asked me "why are they so many old people in here?".. the movie started playing already so it was quiet and everyone just stared at us 😑
- Man I'm sad not everyone has this, but local theater is called MJR and they do this throughout the year usually. I haven't checked in a while since Covid. But a couple years ago the wife and I went to watch Home Alone around Christmas time, and another time we watched Breakfast at Tiffany's. It's pretty cool
- last summer when there was nothing new b/c of covid, my local cinema played classics to be able to stay open for a few of the hottest weeks. Ghostbusters, Raiders, Gremlins, Wizard of Oz, Casablanca... wish they'd do it again.
- I like this idea. I would still prefer that they did these on film instead of digital but that's just me.
- Pre-covid, various theaters in my area would show older films, usually as part of a series. Now that theaters are just starting to reopen, I think this sort of thing will take a back-seat for a while. I think the main focus will be to get butts in seats for new releases.
- One of the reasons i loved Alamo Drafthouse so much. Constantly running specials for classic movies. Heard they got bought out because of the pandemic and really hoping they dont change much
- Cinemark used to have their [Cinemark Classic Series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cinemark+classic+series). First run theaters playing both classic and new classic films on Sundays and Wednesdays in the Fall. (when business was slow anyways) Sometimes they're tied into Fathom events and TCM revivals.

Cinemark hasn't done it in at least four years. I miss it dearly. I saw Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan on the big screen at one of these screens- for the first time since 1982.

But the fact remains that these exhibitions don't draw big audiences- even anniversary-marked ones. I think I was one of twenty people in the auditorium when 2001: a space odyssey made it back in the theaters during its 50th anniversary year.  Still bummed that Raiders wasn't playing locally for its 40th Ann last week.
- I’m so old.  

I read your title and thought ‘Casablanca’, or ‘The Wizard of Oz’, or ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’…. Which were classic movies when I was a kid.

And then you say ‘Jurassic Park’ or ‘Star Wars’ and I think “Oh no…. people think those movies are classic now”.

What do you call movies from the 1930’s and 1940’s if movies from the 70’s and 90’s are now classics?
- I’d love to watch a triple feature of Return of the Living Dead, Evil Dead 2 and The Thing some day in the future. Love those movies.
- We have a local theater (that is actually for live performances but they bought a projector and screen) that does that! For $1 I saw Shark Tale with my kid. We skipped Jurassic Park because as much as I love it, she believes the CGI a little too much. Next week is The Lorax. It’s a great way to see if your kid is ready for a movie in the theatre because if you get part way through and they can’t sit through it, you are only out a couple bucks.
- And here I was thinking the definition of a classic movie would be "Hollywood Boulevard" or "Twelve Angry Men". I think I am getting old!
- I'm cool with this but would be even better if we saw more cult classics come back to theaters.
- Like I want to spend $75 for my wife and I to go to the movies, when we could watch that shit on Netflix.
- I got to see 2001 on an imax screen a couple years ago. It was one of the greatest movie going experiences I’ve ever had. The theater was decked out, they had the intermission…and that restoration was immaculate.
- Holy shit yes.  I got my son into dinosaurs and if i could have the opportunity to go see Jurassic Park with him that would be amazing.  That is one of those memories i have and to know how exciting it could be for him would be so special.
- Absolutely! Saw the one night showing of Boondock Saints like 15 years ago… amazing!
- Alamo Drafthouse baby
- > Classic movies like Jurassic Park

Bwahahahahahha
- If you did a quick search you’ll know they’re plenty of places that do this…
- I would love to see Back to Future, Indiana Jones, Top Gun and many other 80s and 90s movies on the big screen again!
- Turner Movie Classic did an Alien anniversary showing a few years ago in select theaters. It was AWESOME and completed my Alien movies in theatre watch list.
- This was before covid, not sure what's going on now but we have always had a couple of "summer movie" series things here like usually I think Wednesdays, where all classic movies for months at a time.
- The theatre in my town turned 100 years old in  2017 and for it they played a movie from each decade for free. Seeing Charlie Chaplins “The Circus” from 1928 on the big screen was especially cool, and so were True Grit, Casablanca, Psycho and such. I also saw the Elephant Man on ten big screen somewhere else which was equally cool. I’d love to be able to see more like that
- I like this idea. One of the movie theaters near me had Silver Screen Tuesday’s where a classic movie would be shown in the theater. I bet that to our generation now, the original Star Wars trilogy is now a classic. Maybe if they showed Toy Story in the theater again; I can relive the moment I saw the first ever full length Pixar film in the theater. Plus since there are still highly anticipated movies in limbo bus to COVID production delays, this would be a great way to get people back in until Hollywood has time to catch up with the new stuff.
- > Plus, let's be honest, who wouldn't want to see a movie like Jaws or Terminator 2 in theaters?

You'd have to pay me my hourly rate to go to the theater and 1.5x to sit through either of those.  

Sorry, just got here from /all/
- Oh hai mark
- I remember watching Star Wars rereleases on widescreen back before there were imax
- 2019 during the pandemic, my local theater did drive ins with classic movies; I got to see Jurassic Park, Jaws, Back to the Future, The Terminator, and The Burbs all during that summer. I sent to the theater way more often than trying to see new movies, not to mention that I own most of those anyway, but the experience was worth the price.
- I really want to watch the LOTR trilogy in a theater with a group of fans. It's one of my life bucket list.
- I wanted desperately to see the IMAX AKIRA 4K ect … rerelease and right as it was going to play where I was the pandemic hit. 

I wanted to feel that in the theatres since I’ve only ever had the experience it across physical releases.
- Seeing 2001 on IMAX was an incredible experience.
- >Plus, let's be honest, who wouldn't want to see a movie like Jaws or Terminator 2 in theaters?

Can I pay the same price as when they were in theaters?
- I remember when Jurassic Park dropped and o feel SOO fucking old from this post. Lol.
- We were lucky to get tickets to Spirited Away a couple of years ago for our family. It was amazing! We have watched it several times at home, but i noticed so many things I'd never seen before. When theaters started reopening and were offering private screenings, we were able to book a private room for mother's day weekend. We picked Clue as our movie, ordered snacks ahead,  and it was a fantastic experience! It was $100 for all of us. We were the only ones in there, so no masks. Snacks were delivered before screening, so no trips out unless you need to use the facilities. I was blown away by a movie i love and have seen lots, but have never seen it in that context. We need more of this!
- I saw Jurassic Park at a drive-in last summer. It was epic, that movie was made to be watched in the dark outside
- My local art-house cinema in York, U.K. shows old films regularly. Sometimes it’s even a blu-Ray copy if they can’t get a print or a DCP! 

There’s also an art house cinema in Birmingham which I’ve been to a few times that did the same thing. The electric was the oldest cinema in the U.K. having celebrated it’s 110 year birthday but the pandemic seems to have killed it - along with the 88 year lease on the building which was about to expire. ☹️ (saw Ferris Bueller’s Day Off there on the big screen a couple of years ago).
- Cousin and I saw original Indiana Jones in the theatres summer 2019. Was magical.  Tried to do Die Hard that Christmas.  Then… well, you know.
- Alamo Draft house
- Disney actively block such things, hence them acquiring Fox's back catalogue is yet another extremely bad thing. Say goodbye to seeing Alien etc. on the big screen again unless Disney wants to shake some money out of your pockets.
- The wonderful people who run Disney won't let theaters run their old movies. 20th century fox movies used to be very popular at midnight throwback screenings but Disney out an end to that.
- I loved seeing Gone With the Wind on the big screen.
- Guys what are some movies that you would consider "classic" that is not 25 years old?
- In Britain, there's a site called OurScreen that allows you to organise showings, essentially on a crowdfunding basis. Pick a cinema and a movie, and as long as enough people sign up, they'll show it. I think pandemic has stopped it for now though.
- I think you mean older blockbusters. Classics are generally in black and white.
- We went to see the rerelease of saving private Ryan in theaters. I saw it when it released originally but I was only like 12 so the experience as an adult was I think even better. I would love to see Jurassic park or Alien/aliens in theaters.
- i was saying this lastnight as our only cinema is closing down
-  Every movie is better on the big screen but what people care about with movies is convenience. US audiences don't really romanticize the theatrical experience, and it's usually depicted in American culture as an uncomfortable, frustrating experience of loud kids and sticky floors. So with that and the growth of the home video market in the 80s and 90s, it really dissolved the value of rushing out to see a movie you could easily rent or buy that evening if you wanted to. When they rereleased Gone With the Wind in 1969, that wasn't the case. But with streaming, I think you'll see fewer and fewer official theatrical rereleases of classics, especially if it's Disney's intention to remake every one of theirs with modern technology and sort of carefully dust them under the rug.
- James Cameron released an updated version of T2, with improved CGI and a very slight 3d effect to give it some depth. It was amazing to watch on the big screen, since I was 3/4 years old when T2 came out.
- Seriously need Biodome back on the big screen!
- I was lucky to have a private cinema nearby that rented out rooms for people who wanted to watch anything from their Blu-ray library collection. Old classics and recent underrated films. The owners were huge movie buffs and would always be happy to recommend titles to watch. Pity the business went under because of the COVID situation :(
- I have noticed that classic films only tend to re-release on big anniversaries of the original release.

FE: last summer, my theater opened briefly during the late summer. Thankfully in time for the 40th anniversary of the theatrical release of The Empire Strikes Back.

Which made it the fourth time I saw the Special Edition in theaters (86 theater viewings of the original release back in 1980).
- My local Regal (maybe all of them) had a Studio Ghibli series they did month to month a couple of years ago. It was great to watch Howl’s on the big screen and I got to take my niece to see Ponyo (one of her faves) in theaters.
- Yes let's nostalgia bait even more than humanly possible. How about it be illegal for anything original to be released in theaters? Everything must be a re-release or sequel or remake or adaptation.
- Classic movies pre-1970 should be available for me to stream somewhere on line. There are some B-movie mysteries and thrillers and such that someone uploaded to YouTube so I watch those, but I can't see the classics in this streaming era (assuming I can even properly search for them).
- They used to do this more before VHS became so widespread. Because there was no other way to see films in some cases.
- I missed Interstellar in imax and am very upset.
- Put Starship Troopers on IMAX
- Independent Theaters! A lot of them play older movies. We have two in my city and they both play random classics each weekend. And they are usually less expensive than a newer movie.
- Independent theaters do this quite often.
- Local theater and Drive In have been doing it for decades. It’s always been a thing, the big companies just haven’t seen the bigger picture of what movie fans really really want.
- I almost upvoted this until I saw “Jurassic Park or Star Wars”.
- I saw The Exorcist for the first time in theaters when it was re-released under the Director's Cut in 2000. 

It was the best theatrical experience I have ever had.
- Yes!  
Love FE's stuff, but you do have to go looking a bit, it doesn't come to you.   
I've caught lots of movies that way that I was either too young or not yet alive enough to watch when they were originally released.
- A few years ago I went to Singing in the Rain at a Fathom event with a roommate who had never seen it. We were the only dudes in the audience it was just old ladies or grandmother's with their granddaughters. Still think it's a kickass movie.
- I tried seeing *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* like that, showed up, and the theater was completely sold out. I was in a lobby full of angry Ghibli fans, it was a little surreal.
- Saw Jaws and Alien this way, at a Cinerama even. Truly a special event.
- I started following them years ago due to that's how they host Rifftrax Live events.  They would always have trailers for all sorts of classic movies too.  Following Fathom Event's twitter account is a good way to see what is coming up.
- Not sure if it was this program, but I went and saw the Wizard of Oz in the movie theater for some anniversary. It was totally worth it. Really fun to see it on a big screen.
- I got to see Fifth Element and Godfather for their anniversaries in theaters and it was great.
- Fathom Events also does live (or rebroadcast) of Rifftrax which are awesome.  I've seen them doing Krull, Reefer Madness and Starship Troopers.

- This is how I saw Lawrence of Arabia in theaters. God i love that movie.
- I saw Young Frankenstein before the pandemic.  It was a packed theater and I was very very high.  It was the funnest I've had in a theater since the first zombieland.  I was very very high.
- Local drive-ins are also a great place for this. I saw Jurassic Park at a drive in this spring and it was an amazing experience
- I saw the original Alien at a Fathom show. Was fucking amazing.
- I watches transformers the movie back in the 80s and fathom had special screening last year before covid. But I missed it .
- Ah yes, fat home vents
- Yes! I was able to see Casablanca in theaters! And because of FE, my first time seeing Die Hard was also in theaters 3 years ago!
- The 2001 a space odyssey was amazing. I wish they’d do it again
- I saw blade runner, back to the future, raiders of the lost arc, and top gun in Dolby
- They are showing some movie called My Fair Lady but they are charging more than a normal ticket for it. Nobody is showing up for it.
- Atom tickets is a favorite for this
- Saw Saving Private Ryan this way. Super Amazing
- I have seen a ton of the Fathom Event movies.  Everything from Casablanca and Chinatown to Die Hard, Ghostbusters, and Blade Runner.  I look forward to starting it back up again.
- A couple years back AMC did a screening of the theatrical release of Alien, which is one of my favorite movies and it came out 11 years before I was born. Being able to see it in a theater was an awesome experience.
- My mother LOVES White Christmas. When they brought it to theaters a couple of years ago, it was amazing. After spending my whole life watching it on a small screen every year, seeing on the big one was really special, especially with her.
- My local Cinemark does it all the time too
- Yea Alamo Drafthouse does similar things. I’ve caught Jurassic Park, The Thing, and Big Trouble in Little China there. Lots of fun
- Yeea! I first saw princess mononoke on cable with commercials and it was great but was lucky enough to see it on the big screen before the pandemic and it was AMAAAAZING
- yep.
- Yes!. I caught Raiders of the Lost Ark a few years back in IMAX. It was glorious.
- Our local theater chain offers a lot of old movie screenings, and other limited release movies like anime movies. They even opened a small theater in our downtown that has an outdoor grass area for lawn movies during the summer which are usually classics for the family
- We’re lucky in London to have the [Prince Charles Cinema](https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/Home) – they’re screening Battle Royale, Return of the King, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, and Jurassic Park *just tomorrow*!
- My local drive in is doing a double feature of the heights and singing in the rain this weekend, I’m super excited
- This comment needs more.upvotes.  support your local indie theater!  I've got one local to me and you can grab a beer and some popcorn.  They regularly show old films, trilogies, inipendant documentaries.  Covid hit them hard and they converted to a 'sports bar' to skirt regs for a while which was very funny... But they are back.
- Alamo Draft House in Austi, Texas seemed to do whatever the hell it wanted. It was and is still the best movie theater I've been to in my life. I remember paying for 1 South Park Movie ticket about 4 hours before the movie started and watching back to back episodes of South Park while eating food and having drinks until the movie started. Of course, the movie itself is a bit hazy but it was fun. Also, Team America was like a modern Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was great.
- I saw a small theatre showing of Rear Window (1954).  Grace Kelly on the big screen.  you gotta be kidding me with how elegant she was
- Shoutout to the Coolidge, my local theater. They are pushing for a big renovation right now actually 

https://coolidge.org/
- The Michigan Theatre in Ann Arbor showed A New Hope for Star wars day. Was a lot of fun!
- Yep. I work at a independent cinema. Very fun job. Not getting much work thanks to covid. We’ve done Star Wars, Indiana Jones and LOTR marathons in the past 2 months. My boss even asks me what movies we should do. I’ve suggested Back to the Future and Jurassic Park so I hope we can get them!
- I wish! ours closed and became a shitty brew pub that shows movies on the wall with a digital projector off of goddamned Hulu.
- Yeah. Right before the pandemic I saw Alien, Saving Private Ryan, Naussica and the old DBZ movies. That opening scene in Saving Private Ryan hits different in the theater.
- The local theater near me will even do pretty cheap rentals of their auditoriums for you to see movies and you can bring your own or look through their catalog.
- My local indie does this, and will find era-accurate advertisements/trailers to play before which is fun.
- Unfortunately, COVID put all the small independent theaters in my area out of business.
- There were two near me but COVID killed them. It sucks.
- Yup. The theatres just re-opened in my region, so the local indie is playing a mix of this year's Oscar noms and favourites like The Big Lebowski and Mad Max: Fury Road. They screen all kinds of great events over the year, like triple-header Miyazaki nights
- Sadly, Disney has made it clear that they are not playing the rep theatre game. They are either not allowing any Disney or Fox titles to be shown, or charging exorbitant fees that indie theatres can’t pay
- Key words "used to", as there used to be three theaters near me that did that. All closed permanently from covid.
- As a Houstonian I can only say we did have a theater like this. The beloved River Oaks theater. But.....she's gone.
- Went to Beetlejuice at the Logan Theater in Chicago around Halloween and while of course Beetlejuice was great, they played a trailer for The Mummy (1999) and it was like an out of body nostalgia tidal wave
- The Plaza in Atlanta is the best for older films!
- We just saw Jurassic Park and Braveheart in our local theater downtown. Such a great experience!
- I had a local theater but unfortunately, it didn't survive COVID. It was my favorite one to go to
- Our indie theater owners just kicked them out and they had midnight showings of classic movies all the time.
- Shoutout to the Astor theatre in st. Kilda, Melbourne. Watched Taxi Driver, Alien 1+2 double feature, BttF trilogy and Blade Runner when I was living in Melbourne. Such a great experience to watch classics like that on the big screen :)
- Yeah, our big chain theatre does this regularly as well, lots of somewhat smaller movies as well. Usually all over the weekend but sometimes on nights as well.
- Raiders Of The Lost Arc also got an IMAX release in 2012, I wish I was there,  but I would have been 4 at the time.
- I'm pretty jealous raiders is one of my favorite movies.
- The small AMC near me doesn't do it often, but the bigger one in Alexandria VA seems to all the time. Also the Alamo I've been to in Loudoun does a ton of cool stuff like classic movies.
- They do a huge all-day feast for all the LOTR movies, I've never gone but the menu they post is always epic.
- I saw all three John Wick movies in a row at the Alamo. 8 straight hours of nonstop John Wick
- I'm jealous. Aliens is my favorite movie, but I've never seen it in the theater. 

I do have 3 theaters within a reasonable distance that show 'classic' movies. They have all shown Alien multiple times, but never Aliens. I tried pointing that out to one of them via their social media, but they just turned the talk back to Alien and how great it was that they were playing it (again). 

&#x200B;

Thank you
- I miss Alamo. The closed up shop here in KC.
- 2001 was one of my favorites. Seeing it in a theater was a whole new experience. The sound is so utterly overwhelming. The music, the blaring klaxons, even the scenes of utter silence.

- I saw it a couple years ago at the zoo at night. It was unforgettable
- Honestly I would love to watch The Lost World in theaters as well...the trailer scene with the two rexes would be incredible to watch on the big screen. I’m really hoping there’s some sort of Jurassic marathon event theaters will host up to Dominion just like they did for Avengers.
- I went to see the Jurassic Park 3D version in theaters a few years ago and it was great. There really wasn't much "3D," scenes but the part where the Rex busts through the tree branch chasing the jeep was amazing seeing the leaves fall to the ground. Loved watching it in theaters.
- Im hoping they do a 30 yr anniversary in 2023!!
- One of the first "grown up" movies I remember watching in theaters was The Lost World; I was 10.  Jurassic Park scared the bejeezus out of me when it came out on VHS, and I had to see it four times before I was able to get past the kitchen scene.

To this day, I get a slight shiver down my spine whenever the Universal logo plays in the theater, reminding me of that fear leading into something I knew was gonna scare me.
- Didn't Top Gun get Dolby Cinema release a couple weeks ago?
- In Toronto we got the OG IMAX theatre showing re releases and it's awesome. The screen is colossal
- That volley ball scene in all it's silver screen glory
- I saw Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm before and it was amazing. With the intermission included it felt like a movie going event.


The worst part is the theater's AC didn't work that day so it felt like I was in the desert for 4 hours.
- I’d like to add Bridge on the River Kwai and The Great Escape to your list!
- Fathom Events does TCM Classics and one of them is Lawrence of Arabia. I saw it in 2019 in the theater.
- Saw Lawrence of Arabia on the big screen a couple years ago at Harkins in Phoenix, AZ. Was pretty awesome.
- You can rent a theater, and rent a print, if you think you'll get enough people to pay for it. People do it all the time.
- I know it's not in the same "class" as the films you mentioned, but *damn* am I still waiting for my chance to see Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair in theaters. I need it!
- I love my local Alamo.
- I miss Alamo Drafthouse so much, and I only lived in Texas for two years! Good news is that DC is about to get a franchise. 🥰
- As a former resident of Kalamazoo, I will never forgive the owners of the building the Alamo used to be in for kicking them out. Alamo drafthouse legitimately spoiled me
- This reminds me of the time the fifth film in the *Planet of the Apes* series came out (1970s versions), and some theaters would do consecutive screenings of all five films, under the banner "GO APE!" 

[This was the poster many of them used](https://www.amazon.com/PLANET-FESTIVAL-POSTER-1-SHEET-LINEN/dp/B00MBYQIJU). 

When you came out of the theater, human faces looked a little weird.
- Saw them in theatres a couple months ago. It was fantastic!
- Oh man, I’m so sad for you! My dad took me to see all of them whenever they released (I was a huge Tolkien nerd). I’ll never forget how badly I had to pee… 30 minutes into Return of the King. You bet your ass I kept my ass planted for three more hours because I couldn’t risk missing a second of it!
- I saw them all over the last two weeks. Showing in the UK
- Me too, but it needs to be the extended version. A movie theater near me put on the LOTR trilogy every Wednesday going in order a month or two ago, but it was only the theatrical release. I would only go if it was on on consecutive days and if it was the extended version. Intermissions would be nice too.
- Just saw all three in IMAX not too long ago. Awesome to relive that experience.
- They were re released at my AMC, I’ve never seen it so packed. And every week it only got more packed. Experience I’ll never forget.
- The theater near me did each movie of the trilogy extended edition style and it was a phenomenal experience. 10/10 would go alone again.
- My local cinema put all 3 movies on recently, so my gf and I went to see them all. It was a nice rainy day too.
- I saw them all at cinemas but imagine waiting a whole year for the next one.  It was torture and awesomeness.
- I'm hoping they will show it in theatres when the fellowship turns 25. They showed them here when the first hobbit movie came out and it was so special, after all those years, to see it on the big screen again. 
I saw the LOTR in cinemas when they came out. I was 14 (for the fellowship) and it blew me away. I have a son that's 26 years younger than me and I would love to to take him to see it on the big screen. 
The best part of having kids is reliving these kind of things through their eyes again. I've had the easter bunny and santa experience already, but this would be even better.
- My local indie theater did an extended LOTR marathon once, as we all settled in for the ROTK, who but effing Viggo Mortensen shows up, serenades us in elvish and was all around a really cool guy. He was in town for something entirely different and heard about the marathon, he just decided to pop in and say hi. Was the most memorable LOTR experience of my life.  

Coolidge Corner Theater ftw.

- You basically did see them that way if you saw their original 35mm presentation.
- But at the same time they should be in their original format like star wars
- Your local theater might have the ability for you to rent a screen/room and show your own 4K movies.

My brother and I did it a few years ago at our local theater for a David Gilmour concert.
- Imagine if they released the 4k uhd of 2001 a space odyssey in theaters...

But I'm really conflicted I feel a 4k uhd of an old movie should look like an old movie, but I also think it should look like the best it can be.
- For me, we have a local theater that plays 35mm when they get their hands on it. Makes for a fun outing
- WHAT!? I couldn't hear what you said over the loud background music!
- Wow, I never knew about that.  I'm definitely going to be going to some of those once theatres reopen here.  Thanks!
- I would pay a reasonable amount of money to watch Terminator 2 in a theater.
- When the latest Terminator was released, my cinema showed a special double bill of the first two. It was magnificent.

Didn’t make me care any more about going to see the new one though.
- I saw it in theatres when it was released in 3D a few years ago.  Really cool experience.
- The CGI in terminator 2, to this day, still holds up SO well.
- Anecdotally, I'm not sure this is going to happen. Some of my local non-chain theaters stayed open throughout the pandemic (aside from brief periods of shelter in place orders) due to some of the studios & distributors giving them easy and much cheaper access to classic films. The studios/distributors ended those pandemic deals at the beginning of May, saying things were back to normal now. They can still be gotten from the distributors, but not at affordable rates.
- Does there need to be a campaign to get people back into movie theaters? I figured people would be back as soon as the movies are back. 

Once I got vaccinated, I wasn't afraid of going to the movies. I did happen to pick random times at a small theater when it was mostly empty.

I would love classics to be released into theaters again and this summer would be a great time to do it. I am really curious though if it is necessary to drive traffic. I thought everyone would be itching to get back into theaters.
- I've worked for an indie theater for a decade, can confirm. The only time they really do great is if it's something with a rabid cult following like Rocky Horror or you get someone involved in the film to participate in a Q&A. Stuff like that takes a lot of work to promote that most theaters don't always have the staff or time to do, and in a lot of ways it's just not worth it.

Pre-covid we'd do late-night classics once a month and saying they do okay at best is the best way to put it. It's always a fun time and a neat experience especially if it's an actual film print instead of a DCP remaster, but too niche to really be sustainable.
- Every time I've gone for old films they were rather packed.  Confirmation bias, I know, but maybe they're just picking the wrong films.
- Counter anecdote. The theaters I worked at in Boston ran classics nearly every week and midnight movies every Friday and Saturday. They were well attended (some of the more obscure midnight stuff not so much, but he program made money), especially things like Jaws, which sold out multiple screenings every July 4. I guess It depends on where you live.
- Yeah. Welcome to Oldsville. Population: us.
- There's been *many* films I'd wished I'd seen in theaters, but the closest showings have been in like LA or somewhere that's too far away for me to justify for a movie.
- Having seen 2001 (along w Star Wars) at the Senator Theater in Baltimore is one of my top entertainment experiences ever. The Senator is one of the classic Americana old grand movie house, and last remaining in Baltimore, but it has shaky finances for many years. I just havent been to it in years though
- Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens
- Basically this. As someone who was a manager of a Regal location for many years, I can tell you from experience that repertory screenings don’t make any money. People always talk about how much they’d like it, then when it actually happens you end up running a show of Raiders of the Lost Ark for six people and it’s a big waste of time.
- Saw Empire Strikes Back last year in my local Cinemark, my girlfriend and I were the only ones in the entire auditorium.

Now, I've seen Empire a million times at home, I know the entire movie front to back from having seen it so much. I've never seen it in a theater before that screening though.

Absolutely pure magic. It was unbelievably visceral to watch it in that format, I remember being in tears when Yoda is lifting Luke's X-Wing from the swamp as John William's score is swelling all around me. AT-ATs trudging through the snow seem even more intimidating when the projections on the screen are many feet high and towering above me.
- Do they have a 70mm or real imax or Dolby theater?
- *So* good bud. Saw it at the cinema, and have 3D on my TV as well so have seen it in 3D a few times, but I watched it in VR the other week and it was the tits. Best 3D ever, proper natural eye separation, no cross talk or ghosting. VR is amazing for 3D movies.
- My local theatre usually does this 2-3 times a week depending on what's being released. They only have 1 screen and the same setup they had when they first opened about 60 years ago. Amazing experience. 
Recently they started renting the theatre out if you want to host your own movie night there.
- Got to see Big Trouble in a small local theater a couple of years ago. It was so great. I'd love to see Dredd as well.
- I've seen both of these within the last couple of years at Alamo Drafthouse.
- Ahh, but does it have the mighty Wurlitzer like the Castro in San Francisco?

That theater used to do weeks of retrospectives, like Kate (Hepburn) at the Castro, or MGM musicals.  And always, the music before the movie started, and San Francisco being the last song, the warning that you better get back to your seat.
- Me too. I’m surprised they didn’t show it closer to when the sequel came out.
- Not to mention a quick search in your local area and you’ll see plenty of places that do this
- Can someone please explain to me how Jurassic Park isn't a classic movie?
- For real. I saw 'classic' movies and thought, like, Casablanca or something. Then I click in and it's fucking Jurassic Park??

Oof.
- This year is the X-decade anniversary of a lot of big movies, I might try to catch some of them through the year now.  Like, it's the 80th (80th! unbelievable) anniversary of Citizen Kane and they're showing it in...I think September?
- >Love FE's stuff, but you do have to go looking a bit, it doesn't come to you.

You can sign up for their newsletter and be told every month.  It's at the bottom of their [homepage](https://www.fathomevents.com/).
- I took my elderly mother to see it. I hadn't been to a movie with her since I was a kid. That's the day I found out my mom talks loudly during films.
- That movie is way ahead of its time in its sense of humor. The jokes all still feel fresh and funny to me— especially the stunt sequence. And the ending is so great, makes it worth it. Also Donald O’Connor’s backflip off the wall. Kickass is right!
- Because it IS!!!  I was lucky enough to see it my first time at the Hollywood Bowl with a live orchestra and had a stuuuuupid grin slapped across my face from start to finish.
- that's my favourite movie, I would LOVE for an opportunity to see it on the big screen! That's so cool!
- That is amazing. It really is one of those "perfect," movies. I got to see it at the Traverse City Film Festival on the big screen and Stanley Donen (the director) was there to introduce it.
- [deleted]
- Freaking amazing flick. Donald O'Connor is beyond!
- Being able to see *Your Name* in theaters was a truly special experience for me when they did a limited re-release in the city I was living in at the time.
- My local art house cinema show a different Ghibli movie every month or so. I got to watch Princess Mononoke literally just me and a friend with the whole place to ourselves, was awesome.
- Yeah there’s limited theaters in use at my local amc and they’re showing a lot of shit right now too. So Back to the Future was sold out days ahead of time.
- Oh angry it was sold out. I was like... why you all angry about a movie you chose to see?

Me dumb.
- I took my little sister to see it about two years ago.  Theatre was almost full which surprised me.
- Speaking of which, they’re doing another Ghibli fest event this year with spirited away, howls moving castle, castle in the sky, and Totoro. We’re planning on making Totoro our sons first movie experience since it’s his favorite movie.
- I was one of like 10 people in the theater when I saw Spirited Away a couple years ago. They had two days. One you could see it subbed and one was dubbed. It was great.

Something to keep in mind also: at least at my theater for these Fathom events there were no previews and the movie started right on time. So not the usual get to the theater a half hour late.
- My family and I bought our tickets to our fav ghibli films the moment those events were announced!  I'm not surprised they were sold out.  We had packed theaters at each one we went to.
- Took my son to see Alien in a Fathom event - was absolutely amazing. I’ve seen Alien at least a dozen times and the scariness has kind of worn off… NOT in the theater. Was terrifying. I loved it.
- I've always wanted to watch Jaws in a theater.
- I saw that in a theater back in the last 90s or early 00s and I remember people complaining that it wasn’t widescreen.
- I had no idea these were so common! I saw the 20th anniversary showing of The Matrix and I'm dying to see more classics
- Sharknado riff Trax in theaters was great
- Fucking *what?*
- Say what? That's a deliberate intervention by the management/projectionist.

Digital Cinema Packages (DCP) come with the aspect ratio specified in the metadata, and the server/projector combination is supposed to respect that. You've got to override it deliberately.
- I saw a 70mm print of that at a theater and it blew my mind. My favorite movie quote is from LofA. “There is nothing in the desert, and no man needs nothing”
- I really need to see it one of these days.
- That is a good movie!  Yes!
- But were you high?
- I saw it in 2018, I think it was because it was the 100th anniversary of the novel Frankenstein. Definitely more fun than watching it at home. Zany comedies like Mel Brooks films and the Naked Gun movies tend to be better with an audience.
- I prefer Black Christmas myself, but hey!
- I went to London a few years ago, that theatre is my favorite place on Earth. I wish I had a place half as cool as it near where I live.

I got to see ET and John Carpenter’s The Thing. So awesome.
- Damn that’s a quadruple feature worth wading through.
- I literally was just thinking about the Prince Charles Cinema. I'm planning on watching Jurassic Park there next week
- I remember one time they were playing a triple feature of van damme movies. Cyborg, replicant and another, maybe hard target. I wanted to go so badly!
- That is such a good line up! I'd love something like that near me!
- I remember watching return of the king day one in cinemas and let me tell you, I will never forget that day.
- Battle Royale is so fucking good
- I would fucking love to see Battle Royal in the theater.
- Like the Japanese incredibly good but also royally fucked up Battle Royale? Thats pretty awesome!
- I love that place. I’m from Dublin, and back in the 90s with student fares I could get an overnight bus to London in my late teens/early 20’s for £12 return. Only problem was you’d arrive in Victoria at 8am and couldn’t check in anywhere until 4 (and they were still understandably wary of folks with Irish accents wanting to drop off a suitcase and leave.) The Prince Charles, however, opened at 10 and showed weird indie and arthouse stuff for something like £1.50 a ticket, and didn’t care if you had a suitcase and brought a sandwich in.
- I was in London when they were doing the 40th anniversary of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 

 Now I always check their schedule when I’m in the UK.
- And they're often actual film screenings, rather than digital. You forget the richness and texture that can be missing from modern digital projections. Like putting on a record after listening to Spotify - there's just a "feeling".

As pretentious as that may be - even the print of Heat I saw there, which was frankly in a terrible condition in some parts, felt so refreshing.
- Oh man I'd love to see Battle Royale in theatres!
- I saw Blade Runner for the first time there.

I've also seen Reservoir Dogs and Fight Club there. On the website I've seen that they do double screenings e.g. Terminator & T2, Alien & Aliens etc. It's a great cinema.
- Singing in the Rain followed by A Clockwork Orange is the ONLY way it should be double billed.
- [deleted]
- [removed]
- The Rio in Vancouver?
- I didn't even think to mention the beer! do you want to overpay for a 2 litre bucket of coke to drink while watching a movie, or a nice cold beer!  
https://youtu.be/6Pkq_eBHXJ4?t=50
- Where I live there's a couple cinemas like this, though one shows a lot more indie movies and docos and some themed months as well, fantastic, comfy theatre. Other one is more older movies and marathons (recently showed the whole main star wars storyline in a marathon, occasionally lotr extended editions, had 2001 in original format), though known for having the original, uncomfy seats.
- Terror Tuesdays and Weird Wednesdays! Cheap tickets, cheap beers and bad movies. What more could you ask for on a weekday night?
- I haven't lived in Austin in many years. 

But I remember going to the Draft House to see purple rain, and Rocky Horror, and The Exorcist. 

But my favorite spot was the Paramount theater down on Congress. Built in 1915 and showing classic films all summer long. 

Seeing The Seven Samurai there was absolutely brilliant. Hard Days Night, Fiddler on the Roof, West Side Story, Dr. Strangelove, Rashomon, and several others. It was always a good spot to see something you loved. 

Of course parking wasnt ideal but it was a nice way to get out of the heat on a summer afternoon.
- Drafthouse with locations around Dallas too
- I’m so jealous- Grace Kelly is so ethereal in that! Would love to see it on the big screen!
- Love that theater - my girlfriend at the time lived really close (and I lived right next to Somerville theater).
- Well that doesnt sound legal lol

Edit: who is downvoting me? You need to buy the rights to play a movie like that, you cant just stream whatever you want to a crowd.
- Their summer 35mm lineup is insane this year. Saw Jurassic Park in 35mm last weekend, going to see Shaft Sunday.
- Wait….how old are you? How old am I????
- Wait, you’re 12?!?

You should be aware that sometimes we talk about naked ladies on here.
- I was there for that. It was awesome. At the end you could totally tell the "rocket launcher" Indy had pointed at the Nazis was just some pipes and shit held together with pipe clamps. And you could see all of the flies that were around and even went into Belloch's mouth. It was wild.
- I saw raiders at the drive in when it came out
- AMC does it regularly tbh. Just check their app
- My wife and I did the feast one year. That was a hell of a fucking experience, and the food was damned good. I was surprised how on-point the Lembas bread was. 

I mean, considering that's something they had to invent, which doesn't exist. It was very tasty but so incredibly dense and just a bit crumbly but not so much that it fell apart when you broke some off.

I'd liken it to a savory scone that was very dense. 

The whole damn day (and most of the night) was a grand experience.
- I can't tell if that's too much John Wick for one day, or too little.
- I mean, Alien is my favorite film so I'm bias, but if you were just going to show one....
- I saw it on release and the theatre I saw it in had just got a seat upgrade.  One of my favourite experiences.
- Quick story about a release I saw in 70mm in the day. It wasn't entirely uncommon for slightly different cuts to go to theaters, including scenes perhaps taken out in later print and misshipped. In the Aliens print we saw that day it included a scene where Burke is found after he encounters the alien in the back hallway during the smartguns, which is where everyone else saw him last. Ripley finds him embedded in a wall when she's looking for Newt, and he tells her he can feel it 'moving inside me', so she hands him a grenade and turns the corner as he pops it. 

To this day the producers swear it never saw the light of day anywhere until a few (relative) years ago, and my friends thought I'd imagined it.

https://screenrant.com/aliens-deleted-scene-gave-carter-burke-the-death-he-deserved/

I found the scene on youtube a few years ago, and here it is again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FCLyglO_QY

Thanks for coming to my ded talk.
- A classic.
- The T-Rex coming through the fence in the rain is probably in my top 5 movie scenes of all time. Any film, any genre. Just un-fucking-believable.
- The animals must have been tripping the fuck out after the T Rex Roars
- Saw it in theaters when it was released, and it was incredible. My love of the movie has kind of waned since because it's pretty mediocre compared to Jurassic Park, but watching the Rexes attack the trailer and the one rampage in San Diego was incredible in theaters.
- It also got an IMAX 3D release 8 years ago. It was pretty damn awesome, I gotta say, despite the unnecessary 3D aspect of it
- Immersive cinema!
- Yeah! It seriously did not feel like 4 hours when I saw it in 70mm too. It sure helps that concessions and beer at that theater were super cheap haha. 

Hollywood Theater in Portland! It's fucken amazing and I miss it!
- Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that justifies cinema as an art form. You can enjoy it on a television, but you can't truly "experience" it if it's not on the big screen, specifically in 70mm, the way David Lean meant it to be. It's truly stunning.
- Same I saw it for the first time on 70mm and even though it’s quite a long film it was really worth it.
- ironically it was hot during the screening of Lawrence of Arabia?  :) 

I on the other hand was freezing in the movie theatre I saw the movie Alive (Rugby team's plane crashes in the Andes)  in for the first time.  AC was set to a full theatre, and there was no one else but me, so it was like 58 degrees.
- I saw that too. The time I saw it they said the last reel of the movie was damanged so badly they would cut to digital. I thought there would be some quality difference but going from 70mm to a digital copy was like going from 4k to 320x240 holy shit it was insane.

Flags of the different tribes in the movie that has amazing detail became solid purple or red flags on digital. It's insane.
- I saw them at my local college theater. Not the greatest screen or print but awesome!
- Dr. Zhivago is another.
- Can't wait for my local one to open back up. Best theater experience I've ever had.
- I remember going to an all-night marathon of the original Apes movies at the drive-in. My dad took me, my brother, and a couple of cousins to it. The sun was rising just as the fifth movie ended.
- Same here! Back in February my local Cinemark showed them all in order. It was incredible.
- >  I’ll never forget how badly I had to pee… 30 minutes into Return of the King.

I honestly think this was part of the reason why there was so much backlash against the 12 false endings when the movie came out. Every time the screen faded to black, every die-hard was thankful because they'd been holding their need to pee for three hours.

I was also one of those people who needed to pee, but I didn't care because I was actually thrilled every time it turned out to be another scene and not the end credits.
- Did the same, it's been a great way to get back into the cinema post lockdown without the fear of disappointed from a new release.
- It’s not worth waiting for that imo. Most theatres will only play the theatricals because shorter runtimes are better for them. I can only imagine a smaller independent theatre would play extended cuts.

I saw the theatricals in theatres a couple months ago and they were fantastic! (I prefer the theatricals for the most part anyway)

That big screen experience is absolutely worth it, extended or not.
- But I'm still struck today at how *clean* digital projection is. Even in the early 2000s, 35mm prints with frequent screenings would start to get banged up pretty quickly.
- For the 50th anniversary, they released 2001 to most IMAX theaters across the country.

I wouldn't be surprised if it happens again in the next decade.
- Unfortunately there aren’t ton of theaters with 4k projectors, and they are definitely saving those for big ticket new releases. It’s improving, but most theaters still project at 2k.
- That is exactly what they did, actually. The 4K restoration was shown in IMAX for its 50th anniversary, and it was glorious.
- You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a good optical projected 35mm print and a 4k digital projection.

The film was shot on distributed on 70mm which, if you find a theater that still does 70mm, will look better than either.

They play the large format of it in imax theaters from time to time.
- Has that ever been a problem with Interstellar?
- I paid $3.50 to see it the first time!
- I was honestly amazed at how good the 3D was.

Post-converted 3D can be great if they give it the time and resources it needs.
- [deleted]
- It's a chicken and egg problem; distributors don't want to release movies to theaters that have low attendance, and theaters will have low attendance until there's something worth watching.
- Most of my friends have gotten so used to the comfort of home, and improved their systems over the lockdown, so that they aren’t sure it’s worth going out any more. I have 2 movies I still want to see on the largest screen possible this year (Dune and Macbeth), but even I am wondering if having to deal with the general public is gonna ruin the experience.
- Vaccines still do not help with the problem of other annoying moviegoers for me which was my core problem with movies before Covid.   Every year I watch less and less due to bad experiences. 

If anything - I enjoyed the empty theaters.  I would love someone to create a chain of really small personalized theaters but at some point I don't see how this beats out just watching at home with a decent setup and thus, probably makes sense to never happen.  

I hate it because I love movies and movie theaters.  I have a son who is two and I'll likely will eventually go back so he gets to experience movies when he's old enough (and also vaccinated)... but unless I get an Alamo DraftHouse near me or something that can regulate annoying people... it will most likely be very limited.
- I’m one of those people who will always go to theaters no matter what; it’s my preferred way of watching big budget movies, as well as horror (I get more sucked into the atmosphere). Plus it’s just one of my favorite things to do on a whim; I go to the movies alone more than I go with someone.

But in my circle of family and friends I’m very much an outlier because going to the theater is EXPENSIVE. I’m more than happy to shell out $30 for a ticket + snacks (I’m in Chicago for context), but most people I know reserve the movies for very specific films and instead wait for streaming. Perfect example: I saw Cruella randomly a few weeks ago. I loved it and thought it was a super fun experience, but if someone asked me if it was worth seeing in theaters… eh, that’s gonna depend on who’s asking. Someone like me who won’t be pissed about spending $30 on a movie, go nuts. Someone who goes to the theater 2-3 times a year? Yeah, don’t bother; wait for Maverick or Dune haha
- They’ll be wanting more than the standard crowd to make up for lost sales, so a campaign would be to get more people than usual
- After I got vaccinated, I was very excited to go see Godzilla vs Kong.
- This is part of the reason I choose to live in a major city. The indie theater in Chicago can support stuff like this. Tucson? Des Moines? Maybe not. Peoria? Not a chance. That's kinda why I pay a premium to live here. I went and saw a double feature of Tarkovsky films and it was amazing. They were not hurting for attendance.
- When my local Alamo-like cinema plays oldies (which they do a lot) they get good turnout.

When my local Cineplex (big Canadian AMC-like chain in Canada) plays oldies (which they do regularly) the place will be virtually empty.
- I might as well bust out the socks w/sandals at this point.
- Mmmister I'm gggetin awful tired o yer
- Yeah, I recommend the Werner Herzog documentary about cave paintings, it's super immersive watched in VR.
- Because in the pantheon of filmography, calling it. "classic" is like calling Maroon 5 "classic rock"
- *The Birdcage* this month

*African Queen* in July

*Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory* in August

*Citizen Kane* in September

*Silence of the Lambs* in October

*High Society*  (really? OK) in November but also *West Side Story*

*On Golden Pond* in December
- Raiders of the Lost Ark 40th Anniv this month
- It’s still very funny, especially the scene with the sound tracks being off and he has to attach the mic to her dress.
- Make em laugh!
- Its cinematography and editing are damned incredible too and surpass lots of stuff today. They take a ton of risks, it even occasionally feels a bit disjointed, but everything works and holds up even 70 years later. Very few blockbusters today take the creative risks *Singing in the Rain* did in almost every department. *Moulin Rouge* is tons of fun, but something like, *In the Heights*, is more conservative and straightforward (although toward the end there was that beautiful walking on walls scene that complimented the song so well).
- My wife and I are going back and watching all the past Oscar winners. I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality of some of the comedy in those old movies, even ones as far back as the late 20s.
- It’s the exception to the rule of thumb “a musical is only as good as its songs,” because the vast majority of its songs are TERRIBLE, one or two are just okay, but the script and the production and especially the athletic slapstick dancing scenes knock it out of the park.
- I was literally in this thread to say the same thing, I was there that night, too! It was so cool to see it on the HUGE screen and hear his stories about it.
- I saw that in a small theater by the beach, it was a great movie to see in theaters.
- I'll never forget being able to see it during it's World Premier showing at Anime Expo in 2016. Makoto Shinkai was actually there and was taking pictures of the absolutely packed venue.  It was noisy and hard to read the subtitles sometimes, but that was one hell of an experience.
- That was incredible in theaters.
- I would have loved to have seen that one! Its an amazing film! I did get to see Mirai which was great though! My local cinema also played the live action attack on titan double feature which was awesome. Just a shame the sound quality wasn't quite right, the giant monsters weren't quite as scary but they've updated the entire cinema since then.
- I wouldn't want them to hear me ugly crying at the end lol
- I saw that movie in theaters two nights back to back; first subbed, then dubbed. So glad I did, easily one of my favorite movies ever.
- If you ever get the chance, do. 

Also fun: Watch Jaws on your phone or tablet in a little boat or canoe on the water at night.
- [deleted]
- Then the DCP they got delivered must have been made from the same master file that they use for HBO and the like (premium cable often crops to 16:9).

Whether it was an issue direct from the studio or a problem with the venue, either way, I'm more wary of DCP-based screenings of classic movies. They're obviously easier to come by, but they're also easier for the studio or distributor to alter in some way versus original film prints.
- Often times my theater's Fathom Events are delivered via DVR and then just played from the DVR through the projector. Occasionally they are DCP, but mostly DVR.
- Bet they had a t-shirt with a Marijuana leaf on it, a lighter with a leaf on it, reeked like crazy, kept saying how high they were, and said maaannn alot.
- I was very very high.
- I missed out on Carpenter's The Thing in IMAX and it's one of my biggest regrets
- I would kill a man if it meant getting a theatre that would rerelease The Thing in theatres where I live.
- That seems like it would be a fun experience!
- [deleted]
- No it certainly does not.
- I'm 13, my birthday is in June.
- Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
- Nah I'm 13.
- Well NSFW rules don't apply since they likely don't work.
- Slightly before my time. I was able to go to a drive in in Georgia when I was visiting it was great.
- Do they have a short break between films or do you rush the pee break during credits.
- Sounds like a shortbread. Was it like shortbread?
- Neither, it's just right.
- I get that, but the same theater has screened Alien as their classic film more than once. Plus the other two have shown it as well. If you were going to open a restaurant in a neighborhood that already had two pizza joints, maybe you choose a non-pizza menu.

3. Jake Busey getting a knife thrown in to his hand in Starship Troopers

4. "I'm your huckleberry"

5. Marvin all over the backseat of Jules' car
- I rewatched with someone a few years back- They were convinced it was re-done due to the CG being so good. Nope, it was just that great. Truly one of the best films ever made.
- It's alright. Most of the animals didn't get tickets to the movie.
- I saw Top Gun for the first time in that format.
- Move over Smell-O-Vision!
- Oh yeah, that place is great!
They’re programmer Dan rescued over a hundred Shaw Bros. films on 35mm, many of which were previously unavailable. We screened a number of them at the theater I worked at in Boston and Dan came out to tell the story. 

That theater had the same film projectors we had, Norelco AAII’s, aka the DP70. They’re 60years old, run like champs and require almost no maintenance.
- I wasn't a big fan of the story but I 100% agree. It is beautiful on the big screen.
- Just say every David Lean film
- Had no idea there was any backlash, but I’m a diehard fan so I never wanted the movie to end haha
- LOTR  has been shown multiple times in my area and it’s always the extended editions. I wish they’d show the theatrical versions every once and a while.
- More importantly they struck brand new 70mm prints straight from the original negative, and showed them in theaters across the country. It looked insane, our theater got one of those prints and it was one of the highlights of my career as a projectionist. Kier Dulea  came to a few of our screenings.
- I NEED to see that movie and Lawrence of Arabia in IMAX.
- Would you pay more if you saw it at Alamo Drafthouse?
- Saw it in IMAX when it was released and the dialog volume had its ups and downs.
- *”I gave him a dollah.”*
- My post said that studios/distributors have made classic films available to theaters throughout the pandemic. I saw a couple dozen or more classic films over the last year in local theaters during the pandemic. 

I also wrote that the distributors/studios ended the cheap pandemic rates for classic films a month ago, per the owners of local cinemas who were cut off after the first week of May 2021 unless they wanted to go back to pre-pandemic rates and policies for classic films (far more expensive and less profitable for theaters). 

So what I'm saying is that the "campaign to get people back to theaters using classic films" has already existed and ended. I highly doubt it's going to start back up again when they, the studios, are trying to push their slate of first run films over the next six months instead.
- I wonder if they chose one of the three endings for Clue like they did when it was first released in theaters, or just showed all three back to back like in the DVD/streamed version.
- I think it depends on the movie at least for me. Saw a quiet place 2 and it was worth the theater experience. Other movies I'm not sure. I think I'll watch most at home. Snacks are cheaper and I don't have to deal with people bringing a baby to infinity war.
- Saw Lawrence of Arabia and true grit last uear
- >High Society (really? OK) 

Why the shock at this? It's generally considered a "classic".

I have a feeling you're getting it mixed up with some stoner comedy...
- Wait, *Birdcage*? In theaters?! MUST SEARCH NOW
- Oh Willy Wonka will be fun
- No, no, no. Yes, yes, yeeessssssss
- Singing, Make em Laugh, Good Morning are all fabulous

However, really is more of a dance show of course because Moses is hilarious
- I was really surprised when that happened! And during my first Anime Expo to boot!
- The sound quality was probably the most important aspect of seeing it in theaters for me.

Feeling the rumble of the comet completely changes the experience.
- Try it floating on a lake, with something that nibbles on your leg

- Are there still enough theaters in your place that have the equipment AND the skill to handle film prints? I feel in my area in southern Germany there are only very specific theathers that could still do that. Its all digital these days.
- Best "experience" I have ever had at an IMAX was seeing Gravity. Most incredible 90 minutes you'll ever experience. Hope they bring it back someday. I also saw Avitar at the same theater (multiple times) which us still my favorite IMAX film.
- [deleted]
- The recent movies are exactly the ones they can do easily. It’s those and old classics (BTTF, 007, Jurassic Park) they have on hand. Other movies they won’t be able to do
- Cool to see young moviegoers represented, even tho it makes me check the mirror for gray hairs
- so to iterate.

Finding Nemo would be a classic movie to you.
- Hey, happy birthday man!
- I am absolutely sorry that people downvoted you for saying your age and not lying. Have a karma point back. 

Some people are just in love with being anonymously rude.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love that you love movies, thank you.
- The fuck are 13 year olds on Reddit for? You know there’s porn and stuff on here right? Go back to school. Jk though. Wish I had Reddit then.
- Lol this really tripped me up, then I remembered I was also 13 when I joined, back in 2011.
- Oh thank god, anyway what did you think of that naked lady in the movie "naked lady"
- I want to say it was 15 minutes between films, but it might be a half hour.
- Starship Troopers had so many moments that made 16 year old me think "fuck this is a serious movie".  


I saw things in that movie I'd never seen before.  And, I've not seen since, weirdly enough.
- That's a solid list.
- Independence day speech and the dual of the fates. has all but the Rex beat.
- Jurassic Park knew all the tricks to do great CGI during a time where the strongest processor was weaker than current's cheap smartphones by miles. They knew their limitations, and they masked it well.
- "Backlash" was probably too strong of a word to use. 

I just remember that being the *only* major criticism of RotK (which says a lot about how well-received it was). 

The false endings spawned a ton of memes at the time and it was even referenced in the wrap-up scene one of my favorite movies (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang): "Don't worry, I saw Lord of the Rings. I'm not going to end this 17 times."
- If they were still known for enforcing strict rules about phones, and they stopped serving food. I will definitely return to my old tradition this summer and see whatever is playing at the MOMA where both those elements are in place, but they don’t actually have enormous screens there. Personally I’m pretty sour on the public movie experience.

My point was mostly that it’s not something they can do in wide release, it would have to be pretty limited and those screens are already pretty booked.
- [deleted]
- Wow Lawrence must have been awesome in theater. I’m jelly.
- I saw True Grit when it first came out.  Yes I'm old as dirt.
- I love High Society and am excited about a chance to see it on a big screen.   Too bad it isn't a double feature with The Philadelphia Story.
- I'm not confused. This can't touch *The Philadelphia Story.*
- Oh, my hands are shaking. Agador, I need some pirin tablets, quickly!
- Is that the one with Robin Williams ?
- I quote that (with head motions) weekly
- "Good Morning" and the title song are the two best in the film, and I think "Good Morning" is better by far. The funny thing about the title song is its minimalism: there's not much of a tune, and it's just a chorus. You didn't need much more than a jingle to frame the scene and give the orchestra a melody to play with as the dance went on.

"Make 'Em Laugh" is a fantastic routine, but the song feels a little undercooked; it's a sound-alike pastiche of the more famous musical number "Be A Clown," sort of like the sound-alikes Seth MacFarlane wrote for Broadway songs in the early days of Family Guy (before the show had enough of a budget and blank creative check for him to simply use Broadway songs in the show).
- They still exist, but they're getting rarer and rarer. I'm lucky in that I live relatively near Chicago, which has the excellent Music Box Theatre that can handle not only 35mm, but 70mm prints as well, which is awesome (just wish their sound system was a bit nicer).

But there's nothing at all within an hour radius of my house that does anything but digital.
- I think I'd love to see Saving Private Ryan in IMAX. My ears wouldn't love it but my brain would.
- Saw Interstellar in a huge IMAX dome. Fucking insane
- Seeing Christopher Nolan's restoration of 2001 at an IMAX cinema was unreal.
- $2 for a good beer? You probably couldn't even get a Bud Light for that anywhere around here.

edit: Of course it's in Colorado. You guys got all the cool shit.
- Don't worry, your not old in my book,  I have a freind who likes old movies as well, I was actually shocked to learn that he knows what Pshyco is.
- I think finding Nemo is considered a classic either way.
- Classic doesn’t mean old, it just means a highly revered piece of media.
- Fuck…. I’m SO old. 

I really felt Bo‘a song Turning 30. I remember my first job in the 90s. I was the young kid born in the 70s

Then I hit 40 some years ago. 

Also felt that part of his song. Damn.
- I started college kind of late when I was 25 (was born in December 1991) but didn't think of myself as old. I was talking movies with classmates and I mentioned the first movie I saw in theaters was The Lion King and they looked at me like I was middle-aged. Coincidentally, one of them did list Finding Nemo as their first movie.
- Thanks my friend.
- You had Me in the first half lol.
- I'm a 33 year old dude and even though I KNOW there are young kids on Reddit, I have to constantly remind myself. Sometimes I wish that Reddit had a way to verify your age and make it appear next to their username so when someone is being a rude troll I could look and see that they're 12 and I wouldn't be so annoyed about it.
- That naked lady was so good!

/s
- That’s... why I’m here
- Anyone who follows this sub probably knows but there was only like 4 minutes of cgi dinosaurs in the whole movie.  The rest of the screen time was animatronics and classic movie making practical effects.
- Saw it before covid. Was amazing

First movie I went to that had an intermission
- It is! One of my favorite experiences in cinema was seeing Lawrence of Arabia the way it was meant to be seen.
- Saw it in the theater a few years ago, it was.
- Getting *high society* confused with *the Philadelphia story* but actually watching *his girl Friday* -Tommy Chong
- Pirin tablets? What the hell are Pirin tablets?!
- Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Hank Azaria, Gene Hackman, etc.

Drag club on South Beach.

It's phenomenal.
- Make Em Laugh was very openly a rip off of Porter's Be a Clown (Porter owed Freed a favor for The Pirate so he didn't sue)

Good Morning is my favorite from the movie and a fabulous dance routine (the sofa gags are great).

Maybe I just enjoy Make Em Laugh so much because of the dance number - but I'm a sucker for Donald O’Connor or Danny Kaye
- "I had your car towed back here, and all you have for me is lite beer?"
- I think some Hitchcock films might translate pretty well to younger viewers. I got my son and his friends (early 20s) to watch Rope and they were riveted.  Have you seen Rear Window, Vertigo or North by Northwest?
- Definition of classic definitely involves time though. Something has to be older and be judged over time to be a classic. 


Classic : judged over a period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind
- yes, but it kinda has to stand the test of time for that to be true. You gotta see if people still cate about it after like 10 years for it count as a classic.
- One of us. One of us. One of us.
- more movies need this, reupping on milk duds halfway through really helped keep 14 year old me engaged when I saw it in a theater (in the early 2000s, not original run!)
- For me, the first movie with an intermission I ever saw was *The Right Stuff.*
- It's aspirin with the A and the S scraped off...
- Yesssss that's right.  Haven't seen it in years but I remember it being a great movie. Thanks.
- "What are you looking at butthead?"
- I mainly live action movies , but I also LOVE slower paced movies like 2001 and Blade Runner,  is Hitchcock films like that?
- Longer than ten years, I'd say. It needs to still be appreciated by the next generation at least to qualify as standing the test of time.
- Gettysburg for me.
- My god... That's brilliant.
- Not the person you were replying to, but I think so. I only recently got into older films, but *Spellbound* had me, well, spellbound. The tension is amazing, and the actors are great.
- Hitchcock made so many different films but I wouldn't call any of them slow, there's always something going on with camera movement or the set or the dialogue. Or just having Princess Grace in the frame. 


I would suggest starting with Rear Window, it all takes place on an elaborate set of a city courtyard, with a ton of care put into the lighting and sound design. It's charming at first but builds tension to the end.


North by Northwest might be the most like a modern action film, though it might be better said that modern action films are like it. To Catch a Thief is another approachable one and Vertigo might be my favorite all around.
- Kenneth Branagh’s Hamlet, the 4 hour version.
- I know.
- Amazing! I'm always welcome to movie suggestions 😊

Post Title: ‘Jurassic Park’ Roars To No. 1 Again, 27 Years Later Box Office
Author: BrockSwinson

Comments:
- No matter how many times I've seen it, I'll always watch Jurassic Park if it's on
- > Universal’s Jurassic Park earning $517.6K at 230 sites and the studio’s Jaws taking $516.3K at 187 locations.

> 160 of the top grossing 201 cinemas being drive-Ins according to an industry box office report 

Seriously though, glad drive-ins are doing well. Crazy world we live in where a random, independent drive-in theater in a suburb of Montreal (Cine-Drive in St-Eustache, QC) is the second-highest grossing North American theater of the weekend, in the summer no less, featuring a movie from 1993. Imagine someone telling you that 6 months ago.
- I caught the movie in theaters again back when they did that IMAX re-release. Movie is still a damn great theater experience no matter how many times I have seen it now!
- I guess it, uh... found a way.
- I personally believe it was the most “ahead of its time” movie ever
- That would be such a fantastic experience to see this movie in a drive in, from the first sight of the dinosaur to the first T-Rex scene, it would feel like immersive cinema.
- [deleted]
- That was me! I totally watched it two days ago!
- The first Jurassic Park is my favorite one, it has the scariest and most interesting dinosaurs.
- Because they spared no expense
- >Steven Spielberg’s 1993 movie, Jurassic Park, was No. 1 for the fourth time in its release history this past weekend as movie theaters tried to **have a semblance** during the COVID-19 pandemic over what is typically a big moviegoing weekend, Father’s Day.

What horrible writing. A semblance of what? Of calm? Of normality? And they're trying to "have" a semblance? Any active verb would work better there than "have." Maintain a semblance of. Regain a semblance of. Establish a semblance of. "Have a semblance" is very awkwardly worded, to the point of not really making clear sense. 

Do editors exist anymore? That was the first sentence of the article, jfc.
- What year is it? Never mind, dinosaurs are awesome!

Every time I see the title of the movie, I get the main song stuck in my head.
- It recently occurred to me that the reason JP is great and all the sequels suck is because it's the only one without bad guys. The enemy is human ambition, so the theme is embedded in the drama. Even Nedry is depicted more as thoughtless than evil - he's just a Maguffin. 

Fast forward to today and we have Toby Jones dressed like Donald Trump, and the dinosaurs are mere toys for VFX artists and all sense of wonder is gone.
- Thanks The Last of Us 2
- This movie will forever have a special place in my heart. As a little girl I was majorly into dinosaurs (but weren't most kids? Dinosaurs are awesome) and seeing this in all its loud, booming, and intensely scary/awe-inspiring glory in the theater was such an amazing experience for me! Man I was hyped about the movie for days afterwards; I still have a raptor Jurassic Park toy with movable arms and legs.  Lol I thought the Raptors were so friggin cool.
- Movie theaters are doing so poorly that they aren't even trying to have a semblance *of* something.  They're just trying to have a semblance.
- I was in a movie with the young girl in Jurassic Park, Arianna Richards. My one and only Hollywood movie lol
- This movie can only be *truly* appreciated with theater quality sound
- I'm happy to see Jaws has regained its status as a beloved classic. I feel like its legacy was cheapened by its crappy sequels, and the original got somewhat forgotten or taken for granted throughout most of the 80s and 90s. It definitely deserves this second life it's gotten on its 45th anniversary.
- A few years ago my wife and I went to see Jurassic Park in the drive in. When I was a kid I watched THE T-Rex scene an uncountable amount of times, just my favorite. The scene was coming up, and it started to rain. By the time she broke through the cables it was pouring. Here I am in an SUV, in the rain and the dark. Probably the best movie experience I've had.
- Well deserved! The special effects in this movie still hold up so many years on, even when compared to some modern flicks, mostly because of the fact that they used physical animatronics rather than CGI for the majority of the scenes! And what a stellar cast! 

I was lucky enough to host the 25th anniversary showing of this classic at some of my local theaters, and if you'd like to hear me gush (even more) about how much it rocks, here's a little video with a few of my favorite highlights and trivia and easter eggs! [https://youtu.be/J8s4cB\_N-80](https://youtu.be/J8s4cB_N-80)
- My drive in has it slated for July 3rd to the 9th.  Jurrasic park and Jaws double feature.
- Hold on to your butts...
- For anyone that hasn’t read it I just finished the book at 31 years old and it’s fantastic. It’s a quick read that is written incredibly smart, taking some really complex things and breaking them down just enough so you can follow along but still have to think.

At this point it is my second favorite book.
- Back in 1993 I was 8 years old and I was desperate to see Jurassic Park in the cinema. Some of my dad's friends went to see it and reported back "It's too scary for Ashenrohk". I was pretty sad but got over it, and some time later went on to be traumatised by the stampede scene in The Lion King.

When Blockbuster ('member them?) got their copies on video I was first in line. I HAD to see this film. It was incredible. One of my favourite films of all time.

But around around the same time I developed a perfectly rational fear that Velociraptors were hiding in the bathroom and were going to eat me any time I went to take a piss.
- I’m late to the party but modern day CGI still can’t top an early 90’s Spielberg monster flick. The man is a movie wizard.
- Jurassic Park is perhaps the movie that made me fall in love with movies in general.

Like ***Titanic*** and ***Terminator 2,*** it's one of those movies that any person who watches English movies would/ should have watched.

There are sequences in this film that, no matter how many times you watch them, still seem terrifying which shouldn’t be surprising as Spielberg is without doubt, one of the best at sustained horror sequences ( Read: ***JAWS*** ).

There are also scenes in this film that would, even now, 27 years after it was first made, would fill the viewer with just sheer wonder at its scope and majesty ( a shining example of such a scene would be when the group sees a dinosaur, namely a brachiosaurus for the first time)  It is a testament to Spielberg’s prowess as a director that kids always shine in his films (even his more mediocre ones).

The only other movies that have made me feel the same way like i did for Jurassic park are only a handful and even then, they can only hope to achieve the sense of novelty and wonder that audiences back in 1993 would have experienced.

My point is, if by any chance you like movies and you haven’t watched Jurassic Park yet, Please do.
- Ok but I still want to know how the T-Rex crossed the fence and the side he was on was a cliff that the main characters later dropped from
- Dudes, this in the Drive-in would be sick!
- Jurassic Park is in my top 5 movies of all time.
- What an amazing achievement during a time when basically every cinema in the world is closed. Is this like that guy who made a box office number one by renting out the only theatre that was open to show his film?
- Every single time I see this film, I am blown away at how well the effects hold up. Amazing film.
- The Jurassic Park theme is one of John Williams’ best
- Life finds a way
- Well deserved. I rewatch it every few months for God knows how many years already.
- It’s still actually really good
- i thought the first half was really good, not so much the second
- What does that mean "number 1"? The movie that's currently making the most money, is that it? The article doesn't explain it either, it just keeps saying number 1.
- I just rewatched it... it's still the best dinosaur movie ever made. The new ones just had a shitty storyline in general. Even JP 2+3 are better then the new ones.
- Just in time for July 6th Park!
- When I was a kid and jurassic park first came out, it was the one and only movie my parents ever took me to a drive-in to see. To this day, I think it was one of the coolest movie experiences I've had. RIP Union City Drive-in 1966-1998
- There’s something about animatronics that cgi just can’t replicate..
- TRex singing his victorious roar over his prey, banner of man falling limp in the background... this is what iconic cinema is made of.

First viewing was when I was quite a bit younger, in theater. We went for a windy walk after the movie and definitely ran from the TRex when the trees shook from the weather. :)
- The original Jurassic Park wasn't a monster movie, but everyone since then has been a monster movie. That is why everyone one minus the original has been awful
- 27 years later, and the effects in this movie still look incredible. I'm always mind blown when i watch it.
- You did it. You crazy son of a bitch you did it.
- It's probably for research. Might as well bring back dinosaurs for 2020.
- I'm hoping once movie theatres open again here that they show this. I saw it in theatres last summer too, and it's just still so frigging good. I watch it a couple times a year.

And for those who missed it, when lockdown started, Joe Mazzello (Tim Murphy) did a live Q&A watch-along so you can sync it up with that while you watch, sort of a live commentary: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWKRXMFTN0
- Ah ah ah..you didn't say the magic word
- This was the movie where I learned that VHS's have a finite number of plays before the tape breaks.  I love this movie.
- My favorite movie is 27 years old?  Damn I'm getting old.
- I mean, it's probably cos there are no good new films in cinemas rn...
- As it should. My favourite movie franchise
- My first theatre (cinema) experience. Will never not watch this whenever it's on. It will never not have a place in my cold, dead heart.
- Me and my fiancé just recently saw it in our local theater. It was freaking awesome
- The master of disguise rule
- > Of the hard-top multiplexes that were open, the top grossing was Megaplex Theatres at the District in South Jordan, UT ($14,6K) followed by the Palladium 19 in Santa Antonio, TX ($11,2K). 

Where is Santa Antonio? Is it named after Santa? TIL Santa’s real name is Antonio.
- Fitting, considering it’s the greatest cinematic experience of all time.
- People are just getting prepared for the rest of 2020.
- I dont think I'd ever not watch it
- “It’s almost like if you put good work to make a movie people will watch it.... maybe we shouldn’t just keep rebooting the same stuff and making 8 sequels. Maybe...and just hear me out we make QUALITY films!!”

- an excerpt from conversations that will never happen
- Special thanks to The Last of Us 2. Jurassic Park was mentioned in the game
- The movie holds up incredibly well.

In particular the CGI, which was way ahead of it's time and remained arguably the best use of CGI in a live action film until very recently.p
- As a 35 year old man. When they first see the brontosaurus at the beginning. That scene always brings a tear to my eye. Just makes me so happy.
- Jurassic Park is a masterpiece.
- Jurassic Park is a perfect movie.

Indiana Jones was always a bit lighter on story, it’s just meant to be silly fun, and I think with Jurassic Park, Spielberg got to work with a script that was a little higher minded than his original action trilogy, delving into speculative sci fi, morality, consumerism, genetics and philosophy, but still gave him the playground for his infamous thriller sequences and sense of wonder that he is so good at capturing.

It’s lightning in a bottle, really.
- I just saw this at the drive-in last week! So cool!
- The Last of Us II is doing its effect as there is a part that makes you want watch the movie!
- This movies cgi is STILL better than modern day. How is that possible?? I saw this when it came out in the theater the FIRST time and it still blows my mind the quality of computer work
- It's better than any of the sequels
- This is the best god damn news I’ve heard today. Dr. Grant was my first crush, it’s the best movie to ever exist, no one can tell me otherwise! The Lost World can suck a bag of dicks tho
- I watch Highlander regularly.
- Wow we really are out of content. Next comes back to the future.
- Hot Tub Time Machine. Total classic.
- Best movie of all time.
- Ya hace 27 años de esto... Diablos, estoy envejeciendo demasiado rápido.
- Well the Jurassic movies with Chris Pratt suck.
- It's amazing how this film still manages to have s feel good factor to it, despite being a film filled with violence and death, and a dark message at its best core. I recently visited Universal Studios in Singapore,  and the very minute I heard that magicalsl score and saw the banner that read "Jurassic Park", I had a broad smile on my face.
- Can never go wrong with JP.
- This movie masterpiece knows no bounds
- Clue.
- Everyone in this comment thread should check out [The Rewatchables podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rewatchables/id1268527882). It’s pretty much on this exact idea of what makes a movie rewatchable, specifically the kind of movie you’d always watch if you found it on TV. Several of the movies mentioned have already been feature in an episode.
- Predator is my ‘watch if it is on’ choice.  “If it bleeds, we can kill it.”
- The Mummy is that movie for me
- I call it "The Blues Brothers Rule" - if it's on? I am watching.
- It's still tough for me to shave without thinking of dino DNA.  I mean that's not why I use Barbasol, since it's good but cheap, but it's still just such a classic brand now because of that movie.
- I call this the Mel Brooks Effect. “Oh shit, *Men in Tights*! Fuck it, the gym is filled with COVID anyway...”
- Independence Day and Starship Troopers are mine.

I will always make time to watch them if they're on.
- Any LOTR movies. I typically have to watch the trilogy anytime I’m depressed to get me out of it!
- That’s the Rocky rule for me!
- Ferris Bueller's Day Off. No matter what. Balls out after a shower sitting on the end of the bed watching it.
- Lord of the rings, any of the three, are the only films I will watch before it. Every once in a while Revenge of the Sith or Pirates of the Caribbean beat it out, but its depending on mood
- That’s how I am with Twister. That and I love to riff on it
- And the highest grossing move only earned half a million.
- I watched Jaws the other night for the first time in years, and i was amazed by how well it still holds up to this day. Spielberg really was an absolute master of the craft even that early in his career.
- They turned our local Airport Parking Lot into a movie theatre. Pretty smart.
- > Imagine someone telling you that 6 months ago.

"Something really bad is gonna happen in a few months."
- [removed]
- Jurassic Park and Jaws are the top movies and everyone’s going to the drive in. It’s the 80’s again
- Fuck, the article took me back to my childhood, and seeing that fucking jumanji meme again took me back to 2010. what a rollercoaster
- Could you imagine the Vegas betting line on that 9 months ago? 

"What will be the highest grossing box office film for Father's Day weekend in 2020?"

"What theater will be the highest in ticket sales for Father's Day weekend in 2020?"

Bet: "I'll take the combo - Jurassic Park, the original playing at the Cine-Drive in St-Eustache, QC. What kind of odds can you give me?"

Casino: "uhhhhh....100,000,000:1?"

Great, I'll take $1000 on it!
- I would tell them that: "It belongs in a museum!"
- Unrelated, but your name is great
- Oh hey cool! I'm from the next town over from there. Weird to see it on Reddit.
- The sound was the real highlight of that rerelease. The T-Rex roaring in IMAX was amazing.
- I took my younger brother, who had never seen it up to that point to see it, and he was absolutely enthralled. He doesn't even like dinosaurs, it's just an awesome film.
- Oh man.  I saw it in theatres during the original release, and got to see it in IMAX 3D during the re release.   Both blew my mind.  Seeing the T Rex in 3D was TERRIFYING
- Man, I would have killed to see it in one of the legit IMAX theaters.
- I went to that! Was so stoked! Came with free popcorn.
- The 3D/4K remaster? Straight up the only movie I’ve ever seen that was worth the 3D and IMAX price. I’d 100% do it again too. Jurassic Park is pure cinema.
- There's a drive in theater near where I live that was showing it. Was an absolute blast to go and see it on the big screen.
- You did it. You crazy son of a bitch, you did it.
- Well... there it is
- Yeah, but when Pirates of the Caribbean goes #1 at the box office, the Pirates don’t eat the audience
- Way better than *Unsubscribed*
- I suspect its it's because The Last of u
Us 2 talked about it a bunch
- With effects that still hold up.
- 2001 and Wizard of Oz are competitors.
- 'Alien' anyone?
- I agree, it was amazing.

The mind blowing shittiness of all of its sequels just make me sad.  The original is legitimately one if my top 3 all time movies, and had a huge influence on me as a kid (grew up to study biomedical engineering).

Watched it again the other day, and I was struck at what an awesome character Dr. Sattler was.  She is a perfect "strong female character," in the sense that she is ALWAYS on equal footing as the rest of the cast, and when the time comes to be a badass, she heads out there and does what needs to get done.  She's feminine, she's not overly dressed or covered in makeup to make her more sexy; she's dressed appropriate for the field, and never has an unrealistic moment like matching strength with a larger man.  The only time gender even comes up is when Hammond says something kinda dumb, and she confidently blows him off and moves forward, no cringy belaboring of the point.
- Watched Blade Runner in IMAX recently thanks to a Cinemark promotion and I think it's a strong contender. The Vangelis soundtrack in theatres just completely immerses you in the film from the first second, and the sets are still so insanely detailed and dense.
- The Matrix is my pick. So many mind blowing scenes in that movie. The helicopter crashing. The lobby. The bullet dodge.
- Star Wars
- terminator 2 was pretty damn good for its time too
- Its definitely in the argument. Those effects are straight fucking witchcraft for a movie that old
- Apocalypse now too. Though no film has quite replicated it, and late 70s cinema is really great, none of it is on its level visually and technically
- First time at a drive in theatre. 9years old. Sitting in the back seat of a car watching two kids sit in the back seat of car while a fucking T-REX stomps up on them. Watching the eye dilate  when the light hits it is one of strongest and favorite movie memories of my life.
- So tempting to sneak up and shove people’s cars right in the middle of the scene with the t-Rex attacking the cars, people would crap themselves!
- I saw this when I was 10 at the drive-in. My cousin Aaron and I were in fold-oit chairs leaned up against the grille of my dad's work van. When the raptor pops his head out at Muldoon, my dad honked the horn.

That was the most scared I've ever been in my life.

Edit: 10, not 12. Me no math good.
- Especially if a couple people were running around in velociraptor suits
- I saw it for the first time ever as a drive in this past weekend. It was great

And by that I mean I've never seen it before now
- I hope she came to turns with it
- Dude untill like last week I thought Sam Jackson's line "I hate this hacker crap" was "I hate this hack of crap". I have no idea what a hack of crap is but I never thought about it untill I was watching the Red Letter Media jurassic park commentary track and they mentioned something about it.
- I’m in the same boat.  Such a classic.
- We are watching the whole series as a family! Next is is the second one! We rewatched it because our 6 year old wanted to watch it...she fell asleep 15 min in...the rest of us finished it
- It’s really the most “magical”, but frankly I love them all, including both Jurassic Worlds. Dinosaurs still just give me a sense of awe like I’m a little kid again.
- Except for paying Newman more.
- Thank you!
- You know John William's has been N nominated for more Oscar's than any single entity except for Disney?

The dude is a god.
- Yeah, [absolutely!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk)
- *Holeee fuh king shit

It's a die no soarrr*
- Well the thing is, in the book there's very clear bad guys and Hammond is one of them, and dies horribly.

Spielberg and Attenborough put together this naive but jolly rich grandfather figure who got everyone into the mess and had him get a dressing down by a main character near the end that felt like a scolding the old man really needed to shake him up ("You never had control, that was the illusion!")

I can see why later movies left Villains to be a sniveling rich guy (the one with glasses who takes Hammond's estate in Lost World), and middle-class-posing-as-rich that get the heroes into the mess (3) to the later movies where another rich dude is the cause of the problems when modern folks aren't really looking for feel-good rich folks.

The real problem with the sequels is the entire concept of a dinosaur park is so ludicrous that you can only convincingly get characters there once. That's why the sequels just don't work, IMO
- I'd argue that the T-Rex and the Raptors are the bad guys in Jurassic Park. It's basically a monster movie. An extremely tense and well-directed monster movie with superb effects and stellar performances all round.
- That's a good thing to notice, but the enemy being "human ambition" is kind of weird isn't it? 

I think "hubris" would probably be a more appropriate word.

But I think the themes get a little muddled. There are characters spouting off about complex systems descending into chaos (before even realizing the park's failures), talk about how life finds a way (despite the creatures actually having gone extinct), and poor park management (which causes essentially every problem in the movie, but which isn't as explicitly dictated to the audience). 

I don't think that ambition is the enemy here. Maybe profits over worker safety. I don't think it was explicitly stated as much as "life finds a way", but wasn't it at least briefly mentioned that the park was located outside of the USA in order to avoid US oversight? Looking beyond the obvious, the "enemy" seems to me to be more about unregulated capitalism.
- I don't see how Nedry is a MacGuffin *at all*. Nothing about his actions or motives are unimportant.
- I thought the first JW was quite good.



Also the second and third JP do not suck.  They may not be quite as good as the first but they are still pretty good
- Was just gonna say they mention it in the game lol
- That was one hell of a present
- Angus?!
- Yeah. Jaws really didn’t need any sequels. I also believe that JP should have ended with TLW. That’s where Crichton’s novels ended. These new JW movies are garbage.
- The CGI is aging a bit and is a bit noticeable in brightly lit scenes IMO, but the animatronics and CGI used in tandem with them still looks spectacular. The T. Rex night scenes especially look fresh out of 2020
- The problem with cgi is that cheap cgi is terrible and nobody wants to pay for good cgi.
- Hot take: I don’t think that the animatronics are what made the dinosaurs scary in JP1 at all. It could be just as good with modern CGI. But there is a good reason modern CGI doesn’t seem as believable as the special effects in those old movies.

The T-Rex attack is the scene everyone remembers and it is probably the stand-out set piece of the first movie. What makes it so good is not the fact that the T-Rex looks real, but that it *interacts with the characters and environment* in a way that feels realistic.

The T-Rex pushes the car which pushes the heroes. The t-Rex breaths into a window and makes it fog up. Its pupils react to the flashlight. It breaks through the top of the car and presses the glass against the kids. It’s footsteps even cause ripples in water.

These interactions are all very real and physical and believable, they ground us in reality. It doesn’t really matter if the dinosaur is CG or a puppet. As soon as we see that it can physically interact with the heroes, push them around, trap them, breathe on them, the monster becomes scary.

It’s all about suspension of disbelief. Back then, Spielberg knew that seeing a dinosaur was unbelievable, so he included a lot of scenes where the dinosaurs interact with humans in ways that make them seem alive and physical (like Grant feeling the triceratops breathing, or feeding a brachiosaurus and getting pulled by it). He spends the first half of movie just trying to do whatever he can to convince you the dinosaurs are real before the action starts, so you won’t question it when the characters are in danger. He respected the audience’s intelligence and knew that he had to use some magic to make us believe his illusion.

Roger Rabbit did the same thing. Look how often in that movie they deliberately show cartoons interacting with real objects on the set. Picking things up, pushing things out of the way, knocking things over. It’s those interactions that convince us Roger is real and physically present and not just a special effect, *even though he looks like a special effect*.

Today filmmakers demand too much from the audience while insulting their intelligence. They do not take the effort to “prove” the reality of what’s going on to the audience, they just jump right into a bunch of crazy cartoony actions and demand that you follow along even though none of it makes sense. It doesn’t matter how good the CGI is. If something impossible is happening on the screen, it’s obvious and the filmmakers need to work extra hard to convince you it’s real and make you believe it. But usually they don’t even try.
- It’s been forever since I read it but I remember Nedrys death to be particularly gnarly
- What makes you think that they aren't?  They're very patient and waiting for you to forget. Never forget.
- Primarily because modern filmmakers forgot the point of using CGI is to enhance what already exists. 

90% of the dinosaurs in that movie were actually there as straight up animatronics ( like the cursed as hell TRex that nearly killed at least one guy) or as costumes ( in the case of the raptors. 

Hell, this movie was the primary reason behind the knowledge that theropods were the ancient precursors to modern birds. Spielberg got a bunch of the top paleontologists together, gave them state of the art modeling tech and basically said “make them move right”. 

They punched in all the data like attachment points on bones, and threw them into walk cycles. Then one scientist went “hey, does the way they walk look kinda like a chicken?”
- A tool is only as good as its user.
- Take a look at Interstellar. Lots of it is practical effects, and is one of the best looking movies ever made. Did you know they made a black hole rendering engine, which in turn answered what black holes look like?
- I saw it a couple nights ago at the drive in. Truly magical experience
- Favorite episodes are ones they've had Tarentino on and: True Romance, Heat (not Re-heat), Con-Air, Face/Off.
- I'm also noticing that most movies in this thread are '90s movies.
- Thank you *so* much for this. I needed a new movie podcast. I already made it through all the episodes of How Did This Get Made for movies that I've actually seen or interested me. This sounds like a great listen.

I'm also really glad to see that Armageddon has an episode. I was worried it might not. That's gonna be my first listen.

- They are about to show a Garth Brooks concert around the country at drive in’s. The price is $100 a vehicle and it will be playing at hundreds of them. I can’t believe that is even a thing but I’m sure it’s gonna make huge bank anyway.
- I'd guess that's more a function of limited supply rather than limited demand.  IIRC as of a few years ago there's only about 350 drive in theaters in the US.  And a hefty chunk of them are in Idaho and South Dakota for whatever reason.
- It’s like the baseball game at the start of Interstellar.
- Spielberg is the director every film school student mocks and then goes on to copy his shots.
- Verna Fields was truly the key to that film in my opinion. The cast, cinematography, John Williams, and Spielberg's direction are all phenomenal to this day, of course, but Fields elevated the film to an ascendent plane of filmmaking with her cuts.

I think of Chrissie doing her leg-last submergence in that wide shot, and the length of time Fields maintains that shot before having her resurface. Besides the opening shot, of course, I'd argue this is the moment in which the dread of the ocean is really established. It really lets you fully soak in just how vast and unpredictable of a void it is, which is the perfect tone-setter. Then it reminds you that you're in there with the character you're watching, with that big closeview. Just fantastic.

There's of course Quint's establishing scene, but I doubt I can say anything new and meaningful there. Though I think a lot of people get really caught up in *that* camerawork from the beach scene beforehand, when there is a lot more to that scene to be appreciated alongside it. I love the dialogue and comedy-tinged paranoia before Kintner's death, and how defeating it ultimately winds up feeling in spite of how quickly these characters arrive and make a complete exit within the narrative. There's no music in the first two-thirds of this scene, and it works far better in servicing and freeing Fields' editing than an accompaniment arguably would. She juggles your attention between layers of the soundspace intertwining as Brody, and the viewer, attempt to focus their attention on the potential victims at sea, with his 'friends' and Mrs. Brody serving as a frustrating distraction. Mama Kintner's acting here is really phenomenal as she's calling for her son in a tone of peak concern and desperate self-assurance, feeling extremely concerned but also certain he isn't dead, because he can't be. It really shows in her choked confusion just a few 'Alex'es later. Astoundingly believable and really one of the most succinct, yet hard-hitting, moments of sudden grief in a movie. She's great in her later scene, too. And again, Fields edits it all to perfection by employing Mama Kintner for only just enough screen time to hit the maximum of emotional relatability each time.

This is one of those standout movies from the 70s, in my opinion, that features editing polished to a sheen that is just inherently modern. It was captivating, subtle, and nuanced back in 1975 and remains so today. It's timeless. Also, people complain about the shark looking 'fake', but I honestly find the lack of life to the shark to be one of the most disturbing qualities of the film. It comes across as truly soulless and carnage-minded, and a lot less elegant than real great whites. I feel like Spielberg (and Benchley) intended for it to be a disturbed anomaly that was exaggerating the proportions and appearances of sharks to create an analogy for Mother Nature's darkest possibilities, and imbue the film with just a few hints of mysticism.

It's honestly tragic and troubling that shark killing soared in the years to follow this film, and remains high up to this day. It's a shameful oversight that what people took away from this film is a message about the goodness of killing scary predators, when at heart it's about the study of a community's response to infliction, approaching the perspectives of a number of characters. A study underpinned by what I consider a borderline cosmic horror icon. Granted, they did have to cut a lot of its use, but that ties back in to the film's ability to amplify itself with some perfect peaks and keep itself clean of filler and lackluster scenes thanks to Verna's legendary edits.

Anyway...I was going to write more, but it's past 7 A.M. and I still haven't slept. I've been thinking about this movie a lot, though, in spite of not having seen it in at least a couple years.

Edit: formatting
- The filming of that movie was also a total disaster where Spielberg made tons of massive errors.  He was only 26, and the shooting went 100 days over schedule!

- Jaws came out in the 70s and Jurassic Park came out in the 90s, so not quite, but this truly is a strange time
- It's not. There's entirely too little cocaine.
- actually... the classic Jumanji in a drive-thru would be pretty good
- QTpie is great at playing QT-esque characters.
- I know it isn’t a crowd favorite, but I got chills when the new Godzilla roared. It took me back to all the cheesy monster movies I loved when I was little.
- And hearing the score in theatrical surround is fantastic. Jurassic Park is one of Williams' best.
- I got a Bose 321 every movie sounds like you’re at the theater. It’s worth it. I can’t bring myself to buy the more expensive Bose systems but if you can afford it do it.
- I was having internet issues this weekend so I naturally popped in the movie while needing something to watch and I STILL love it and in fact during that watch I came to the conclusion that the scene with the t-rex breaking out of his paddock is one of the best paced scenes of all-time.
- My local drive-in showed it as well! It was amazing because we had seen it when it was first released at the exact same drive-in when I was a kid.
- I went to this event! I've been a lifelong fan and it was fantastic. It is such a perfect movie.
- People often forget that it wasn't just the visual effects, too. It was only the second major release (after Batman Returns) with digital surround sound and that was just as mind-blowing.
- While not nearly in the same league, Terminator 2 was released on July 3, 1991. I’ve always been blown away by that fact. JP and T2 get my vote for action/adventure movies that were ahead of their time.
- Okay, I’ll agree to that. That’s pretty amazing company though
- 2001 is definitely not for everybody though. There’s a full 3 minutes of nothing at the start and then like 12 minutes of monkeys or something. It’s symbolic of course, and artistic and absolutely ahead of its time, but Jurassic Park is palatable  as well. That goes a long way because there are people who won’t watch an old movie for the sake of it being old, and yet they still watch Jurassic Park.
- 2001 was so ahead of its time we still haven’t caught up with it.
- 2001 is STILL ahead of today.
- 2001 is my favorite movie. I'd also put Blade Runner in the list
- ‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ says “hi.”
- Fun fact: the snow in wizard of oz that covers them when they are running through the flowers was straight up asbestos.
- Alien is timeless, with only the screens and maybe haircuts giving it away.

.. And maybe also the android death scene.
- My first thought as well! That movie holds up so well today. Still, I think there are lots of movies who can share the nr 1 spot :)
- Or Citizen Kane, the first modern movie.
- I am so sad because I watched Alien for the first time a year or so ago and I didn't like it.  It felt too dated for me.  I felt like such a zoomer.
- “God created dinosaurs. God destroyed dinosaurs. God created Man. Man destroyed God. Man created dinosaurs.” 

“Dinosaurs eat man...Woman inherits the earth.”

Love this line, and Sam Neill’s reaction is perfect.
- I really don't get the hate JP2 gets here. It's a damn fine movie with a lot of awesome scenes/scenarios like the tall grass raptors and the wildlife hunting party. The only part that I don't like is Malcolm's daughter doing that flip into the raptor. Is it as good a movie as JP? No, but then nothing really is. Is the T-Rex in a city thing silly? Yes. It's  still a great follow up and a neat dino movie.

JP3 though? Blah.
- 
I've always thought about this as well, especially in the context of the fact that the movie really has no singular hero character. 

In most movies like this, the man is definitively the hero and the woman definitively the sidekick. 

In Jurassic park if there is any singular hero it's the T-Rex who is... wait for it... female!
- The amazing thing is they really de-sexualize (is this a real word?) in the movie compared to the book. In the book she's like 24 years old and there's a lot of commentary about her body and how sexy she is. Weird because it's usually the other way around.
- The women of Tremors compare. Especially 1-3, 4 too I think but I haven’t seen that one in awhile.
- [deleted]
- It's even better in the book. The author tried to get everything as close to right as possible and it shows. Honestly, I'd love for someone to go and try to update it, similar to how they did JW. But yeah, JP got me into science, so I'm happy.
- [deleted]
- I was around that age when it was first in theatres. First movie I saw that was absolutely astounding.
- "Constrict" you mean. When a pupil opens up it dilates, when it gets smaller it constricts. It constricts when the light hits it.
- I feel ya bro. Front row (very front, neck craning row) of the packed theater when that damn raptor jumps up at them as they go into the vents. Amazing.
- I doubt it. I actually haven’t spoken to my side of the fam in like 10 years. Never been better.
Luckily I ended up with a nice mother in law.
- I wound up watching all five movies. So good.
- "Magical" is an apt word for it haha. Though honestly, for me, it was never about the dinosaurs (though they are awesome). The real appeal of the original JP was always the computer and problem-solving vibe. "It's a Unix system, I know this!" "You didn't say the magic word..." I'm really not sure what the right term for it is. It's not a hacker movie... I guess techno-thriller is close enough.

And while the movie is great, the original book REALLY does the programming/engineering theme well. Crichton is an expert of writing realistic-sounding technology scenes. Seriously, with the in-depth explanations of the DNA sequencers and the park management systems, the original JP was practically a book about computing, not about dinosaurs. And I will always insist that the "counting dinosaurs" scene is one of the best software bugs ever depicted in fiction (possibly second only to the "teletype bell" thing in Andromeda Strain, also by Crichton). It just feels so realistic!

EDIT: And I totally forgot to mention the scene where they realize they've been running on auxiliary/generator power the whole time, and the entire park shuts down. Love how nobody knows what's going on at first, and the only indication of a problem is a cryptic error message coming up in the control room
- > I love them all, including both Jurassic Worlds.

Me too. I can see why people might absolutely hate Fallen Kingdom but I switched my brain firmly off and had a blast. The only single moment in it that I hate is the dinosaur pretending to be asleep and *smiling* just before it attacks the Evil Military Dude. The rest is fun.

Though I'll go with the many people that say that the first 1/3 of the movie could / should have been the entire movie.
- And locks on the doors
- Well deserved. Jurassic Park has one of my favorite soundtracks. I cant believe he wasn't even nominated for it.
He's also responsible for Indiana Jones, Star wars, Jaws and other stuff.
- Agreed. He’s pretty much done a score for at least one movie that almost everyone on earth knows of.
- The book really is a masterpiece. Hammonds character was a lot different - in the book, even at his end with the compys, he believed the park was “salvageable”. In the movie he admits that it cannot be endorsed. I still remember reading the part with the aviary - incredible portion which I’m not sure made it into the movie at all.
- Not really. As Dr Grant says in the movie, they're not monsters, they're animals. The biggest example of this is in action is the T. rex killing and eating the raptors, essentially saving the protagonists. 

That would be like saying the shark was a "bad guy" in Jaws when it's meant to be the mayor that wont close the beach
- Are they? There is that dinner scene where Elie argues that they have no idea what century they're in and they will defend themselves.  I don't think the dinos were ever viewed as villains. Especially when half the protagonists were committing their adult lives to studying them.
- No - that's the difference with Jurassic Park. It's not a monster movie. Dinosaurs had always been used as monsters before, yes: as creatures like Godzilla. But in Jurassic Park the dinosaurs were not monsters but dangerous wild animals. The genius of the movie is to convince us of this with all the little details. The dinosaurs sneeze and they shit and they get sick and their breath steams up windows and when you get to their enclosure on the zoo tour, just like at any other disappointing safari park outing the blasted animals _don't show up_. They've even got David Attenborough's big brother along to tell us all about them.

The movie would never have been so successful if it had given us monsters. Jurassic Park made us believe in real live dinosaurs.
- Michael Crichton published several books with themes centering around the consequences of rushing into new technologies. Essentially humans arrogantly rush into amazing new technology X without thinking about risks and calamity ensues. Jurassic Park the book was all about the amazing potential of bioengineering and the subsequent horror that befalls the arrogant humans. The money aspect of the story was simply the motivator for the humans to pursue the tech in this story. In other stories the humans are motivated by other factors but end up with similar fates after trying to develop things they don’t fully yet grasp.  He also ties in themes of human belief that we can control/harness things that are beyond our capabilities (technology, disease, other living things, etc) which fits in with Jurassic Park as well.
- MacGuffin no longer means anything. People have been using it for years as a stand-in for "plot device."
- agreed, but i maintain 2 wasn’t perfect but felt right in line with the universe of 1. 3 is where they kinda lost me
- "There was a sequel ... It wasn't very good."
- There’s a reference to Jurassic Park in Part 1 as well. I’ve been wondering if Ellie was named after Ellie Sattler.
- Yup! It's actually a pretty decent movie with a killer soundtrack!  90s nostalgia
- Well, we'll always have Crichton's Westworld.
- Might be an unpopular opinion here, but I prefer JW 1 over JP 3. I don't think Jurassic World is an awful movie, just a mediocre popcorn flick that could have been way better.

Fallen Kingdom was so garbage though.
- The Lost World was such a great book.  The movie really didn't do it justice.
- Part of the magic is that they knew CGI was limited. They carefully arranged the whole situation to look good, despite the fact it was a burgeoning field. 

Nighttime, with limited light sources. Raining, so the surface of the T Rex’s skin is shiny instead of having skin occlusion. Very short scenes that actually use CGI, but placed at key moments. 

The effects are amazing not because the CGI was so amazing, but because the movie was directed with the limitations of CGI in mind.
- That’s because that’s a real 12,000 lb animatronic TRex. Practical effects FTW
- Well that and they find him ......
- Around a third of the dinosaur effects are CGI actually. It's a lot higher than many people think. *That's* how good the effects were. IIRC there's about 13 mins of dinosaur action, and 4 mins of CGI.
- My favorite fun fact is that Steven didn’t care that raptors weren’t as big as they are in the movie. After acting as a consultant, but while the movie was still in post, Dr. Robert Burk went back to his dig site where they then discovered the Utah Raptor which is the size of the velociraptors in the movie. Dr. Burk then got to call Steven and let him know that his raptors actually existed.
- Heat is just so so watchable.
- Ah man, They do stuff about those?? I LOVE all of those movies... 'No more drugs... For this man!' lol
- It has nothing to do with the fact that a large number of redditors were at their most impressionable age during 90s.

It has nothing to do with that ok.

It's...you what they call a... coincidence.
- "**GET TO DA CHAPPAAAH!**"
- You cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder?
- "I see they got you pushing too many pencils."
- Ok, tell me just what I listened to there, I think my brain was overloaded
- Because it’s got all the best things! Action and adventure in an awesome (and unusual) setting, funny characters, badass hero and heroine, and starkly different compared to everything else out at the time.

I’m pregnant right now and literally naming my kid after one of the characters.

- When I was a kid I thought the movie ended after the Warden shot himself.  I guess since there is a commercial break.  So it wasn't until like my 3rd viewing I saw the part where Red gets out of jail and goes to meet Andy.
- Yes it was on my TV the other week! Rip Ian Holm
- There was an Aussie channel that had 24/7 fifth element the other week. I ended up watching about 3 times in 2 days
- A god damn institution..

Random lines I say that no one says: hey man give me some heat man.
- "Multipass?"
- And don't forget The Hunt for Red October
- Goodfellas!
- I swear that the graphics and special effects in that trilogy were way ahead of their time.

They could have released alongside Solo: A Star Wars Story for some extra attention ( or any of the other movies, really). It seemed too perfect an opportunity that I actually had some hope for it.
- Bert Kreisher did a stand up comedy tour at drive ins. I would have gone if he had come out my way
- I don't even like sitting in my car.
- Dude garth brooks is like one of the top 5 biggest selling musical acts of all time. He did a tour last year where he played nothing but baseball stadiums.
- Not drive through but where I am the local cinema chain puts on all sorts of things - e.g. André Rieu in concert, WWE Royal Rumble, Soccer World Cup etc.
- We went to the drive in a couple weekends ago and before the movie they said they had a camera team there taking footage for a Garth Brooks production. They asked everyone to honk their horns and flash their lights for 2 minutes. I assume it must be for this show.
- I think most of us youngins have forgotten that Garth Brooks was THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE WORLD at his peak in popularity.
- Wait, SoDak has them?  I haven’t seen any the few times I’ve been down there before, but then again I wasn’t really looking for them.
- >Spielberg is the director every film school student mocks and then goes on to copy his shots.

And there are probably people copying some other director's shots, not realizing *that* director was copying Spielberg.
- He gets mocked? Because he makes blockbuster movies or why?
- That was a good read there thanks :) The last time i watched Jaws before the other night im pretty sure i was still a kid. So i knida missed out on the fact that the Shark isn't really the villain but i totally clocked that this time.
- >It comes across as truly soulless and carnage-minded, and a lot less elegant than real great whites.

You captured something here that I have always felt about the shark from Jaws. I've heard Jaws criticized because the shark doesn't look like a real shark, which I think is not only a stupid, absurd criticism, but I think the movie is actually better because the shark doesn't look "real". It looks like a monster more than just an average shark. It reminds me of old paintings and illustrations of sea monsters.
- If you take the average, it's the 80s.
- Outside of the usual human story that people don’t care about, I fucking loved that movie. I don’t understand why people aren’t into it.
- My nips get hard thinking about that score
- It's the scene I use to test my bass and surround speakers. Its like seeing it for the first time, everytime. I just feel like a kid.
- I've seen it in a variety of formats: tv versions, vhs on a 13" crt, dvd on a 55" rear-projection, even in a proper theatre during an anniversary screening.  

Seeing it at the drive-in was by *far* my favourite way to see it.
- Just saw Raiders of the Lost Ark in IMAX. One of the best movie going experiences in my life.
- That ear-splitting THX sound!
- I remember that for years if you went to a store to buy an audio system, they would have surround sound speakers in a room...  the demo that they played would be from Jurassic Park.  They always really liked the scene where the herd of yellow running dinosaurs come barreling over the tree trunk and over the heads of Grant and the kids.
- Terminator 2 really holds up today, even the CGI doesn't look too bad. Amazing to watch early 90s CGI compete with 2020 CGI.
- Yes. T2 is leaving everything behind. The Matrix  is also in the big league.
- I feel like from The Abyss,  to Independence Day,  it was an incredibly creative time for special effects. Movie makers that refined their skill with practical effects,  got a new tool in CGI.
- I say T2 is in the same league. That movie was amazing when I saw it in the theatre and still is. 
I love Jurassic Park too, but T2 is the one I’m still watching several times per year 29 years later.
- Jurassic Park is my favorite movie and has been for 27 years. That being said I will say the T2 is absolutely in the same league.
- I'd compare it to the original King Kong. They both really stand out  as to how they tell the story visually, given a pretty simple premise. Also, for the characterizations of the monsters. You get a lot of emotions from characters that never speak.   


I just want to add Citizen Kane to the discussion. The narrative structure, characters, and editing are crazy for the time.
- [deleted]
- Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, insanely slow start.
- Came a decade after 2001,  and they look like they could be released at the same time.
- As others have noted, you could argue that it's greatness is not being ahead of its time but being both gloriously of its time and completely timeless.
- Sam Neill was perfectly cast for that film and I think he's part of why it holds up so well.

Had it been a better known, more a-list-y actor, the whole thing would feel different. He made it feel realistic by being a less familiar face.
- I love JP2.  It was my favorite as a kid but JP1 is, by far, the best.  I'm not a huge fan of the Jurassic World sequels.  They could have done better.  They tried to follow the Marvel format too much.  Way too much humor and CGI that takes away from the terror the movie should have focused on.
- JP2 is tolerable in my opinion, those two moments you noted aside.  But after that, I feel that it was a sharp drop off.
- Having reread the book recently, I honestly think the movie is better.  The book is a little more violent, but the movie I think was better structured
- > JW2 which is just a shitty remake where only the bad guys die in a tiny house

Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I actually want more Jurassic Park done in they way JW2 was toward the end, the more "horror" style, IMO.
- The pace is somehow slow in that movie. So if the setting, music, ambiance, etc doesn't catch you, I guess it will be boring.
- I think it's more interesting if your mindset is that you are watching a Noir detective movie instead of a sci-fi. The sci-fi element is about explaining the motivation of the antagonists, and providing a setting - but the story is classic detective.
- [deleted]
- Forget the scifi. It's a noir, watch it like one.  You're buying into the weird bias where it's held up as a sci-fi example but that's all incidental stuff. None of the best "scifi" is straight scifi, that's an age old rule.
- r/whoosh
- My ranking: 1 (league of its own), 2, 4, 5, 3 ("Alan!")
- Counting dinosaurs?
- Harry potta, ET, Close Encounters. The list goes on and on even.
- Not to mention from 1960-2000 he did at least one film score (oftentimes more) every year except for 1985 and 1994. Legend in every sense of the word.
- It really is surprisingly brilliant when you read it after watching the movie. It's easy to expect light entertainment.
- [removed]
- That's the case with almost all monster movies. I doubt you would disagree that Godzilla and King Kong were monster movies, and in both of those franchises the "monsters" are not acting out of malice. Man's callousness and disrespect towards nature and natural order is almost always the "antagonist" in monster movies, and that point is explained in detail in Jurassic Park.
- But they serve the same purpose nonetheless. They're actively hunting the humans during the course of the film and serve as the main threat. Sure, all they're looking for is a good feed, but that still makes them the great obstacle that has to be overcome. After all, take those carnivores out of the equation and Jurassic Park wouldn't make for a very suspenseful story. It's classic monster movie form. Alien (1979) essentially follows the same template. The xenomorph in that first movie technically isn't 'evil' either. It's just an exotic animal from another world that's acting according to its biologically determined nature. Still a monster in the eyes of its prey.
- You're 100% right. The raptors are the closest things to "villains" because they're smart enough to figure out the environment around them, but ultimately they're just acting on millions of years of instinct - the characters often point to Hammond and his team as the ones in the wrong because they're toying with things that should have been left well alone.
- Yeah 3 was iffy for me as well but I still think it’s fun
- 2 should've been directed by James Cameron.  Gimme Aliens with dinosaurs :).
- Did a marathon rewatch of them all recently and still enjoyed 2 and 3 more than the Jurassic World flicks
- Do they say this? Jurassic park 2 was good!
- The alternation between practical and cgi really helped too. You see that big heavy foot squish into the mud and it feels real, enough that your brain believes it when you see the whole cgi dinosaur
- And then the anamatronic t-Rex would sometimes move unexpectedly when it was wet and scare the bejaysus out of the cast and crew!
- Absolutely loads of the rex is CGI though. The very best example is the first time the rex tears at the tyres of the upturned car. The *whole shot*, including the car, is CGI.
- Not entirely. There’s a lot of tricks they used cgi wise.
- Kinda weird that the guy who says that goes on to direct The Notebook, lol
- In fairness it also has a lot to do with the fact that the kind of non-franchise mid-budget movies which were the bread and butter of studios in the 90's basically don't get made anymore, and that's the type of movie which has these "rewatchable" qualities.

- Yeah but this is just watching a video of a Garth Brooks concert...... for $100 a pop......   I hope the drive ins make good money from it, but I just don’t see the appeal in that. Especially for the money.
- Glassing over at Garth show sounds kinda cool neat and slick. at least you wouldn't have to smell Bert..
- I can't believe people are paying money to go see that smelly dog fucker.
- I don’t think he started yet. But within the next couple days
- I'm gonna take a wild guess and say i bet its kinda the same as a lot of younger people who are into alternative music loving to bash Nirvana. Because his work is so widely praised and appreciated dissing him might be a way to set themselves above the common mud among us.
- Same reason there's always some musicians who crap on the Beatles... Or artists who crap on Picasso....

They're contrarians haha.
- Because people forget that he wasn’t just ET and Jaws and JP but Schindlers List and Munich and Lincoln and Amistad. He has moved more into the EP roll than ever in recent years and because his directed blockbusters haven’t ruled the world in the 10s like they used to it has become “what have you done for me lately” with a certain crowd that thinks he sucks. It’s fun to shit on the King I guess?
- Ah, the statistician.
- r/theydidthemath
- People tend to forget Godzilla’s origins. Strings keeping Mothra up, the obvious cardboard cities etc. It’s a super fun franchise and should be taken in a more lighthearted way imo. Also his freaking atomic breath is strong enough to launch him out of a black hole. Godzilla is king ^^^^fight ^^^^me
- [deleted]
- The sound design overall for the movie is amazing but that scene in particular is just PERFECT! Like anytime I watch it I remember every little audio beat from the fence creaking and wires snapping to the bits of silence in between the rex attacks on the jeep and such. It is nothing short of brilliant honestly.
- I didn't wear pants the whole time
- [removed]
- Compared to I Am Legend, the CGI in 1991 T2 looks like a masterpiece.
- It's a really interesting topic.  There's a very good reason why it stands up so well.  In every industry there are the Elite who are just incredible at what they do.  The best of the best.  They were the folks who worked on the early CGI.  There were a tiny number of people with the skills to do it.  Both T2 and Jurassic Park were done by the same (very) small group of people at ILM.

Fast-forward to 2020?  You've got sweatshops filled with raw talent churning out CGI in days/weeks.  It does not usually turn out amazing.

People assume that top-quality CGI means top-quality technology.  It's not that simple.  It's the people working on it who make it amazing.  It's talent and artistry as much as it is technology.
- Thats actually pretty interesting and probably true. Closest I've seen since is mad max fury road
- Citizen Kane basically formalized cinematic language, it seems weird to try and compare with what came after. It's like a Shakespeare piece for the moving picture.
- They may look like they could have been made at the same time, but while Space Odyssey used almost exclusively tried and true methods, the visual and audio effects in Star Wars were revolutionary in many ways and helped pave the way for better effects in other movies; something 2001 didn’t do at all. Many of the scenes in Star Wars were technically more complex than anything in 2001 and could never have been achieved with the same techniques and technology.
- How was he so good in JP and so appalling in Event Horizon?
- I only had The Lost World on vhs as a kid & not the og JP so I actually saw it many times before seeing the original. The original JP is definitely a lot better (plus the book is better than its sequel too), but JP2 still holds a special place in my heart despite its flaws.
- I've done that three times. I'm still not sure what I watched.
- I struggled for years with that Miyazaki film with the bobble-head tick-tock spirits and the pollution wolf. I *could not* watch that movie without falling asleep. My friends and most of the internet talked about how great it was and I really wanted to be into it with them. Eventually I made it through. I don't have any criticism of the movie. I respect the artistry and vision, but I just never *got* it.
- Bro it’s been a long year.
- It’s Hammond. Hammond is the bad guy.

- Hahaha right! Honestly I never looked into him, until he was in Entourage, and made Vince do the crazy driving stunt..
- [deleted]
- Absolutely. He had (has?) charisma and charm in spades, it's such a shame the industry chewed him up and spat him out.
- He's absolutely spectacular in that Doom Patrol series. It's mostly a vocal role but damn he's great in it.
- No, the fifth element is cheating
- Tombstone here.
- CON! SONAR! CRAZY IVAN!!!!!
- Shome thingsh in here don't react well to bulletsh.
- The “Groundhog Day” rule in our house.
- Would you say there are a plethora of movies with this rule?
- I think I am the only person on Earth who has not seen Forrest Gump or Princess Bride.
- Yeah, this thread already had me longing for the projection screenings of The Lost Boys as the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk every summer.
- I thought it was being performed in real time, like when they show operas at the cinema?
- Lot of movie theaters in my area were streaming wrestling ppv for a while a couple years ago for like 30 bucks a person or something. Was a lot of fun
- Yeah that’s ridiculous. I’m down to pay for things but that’s the cost of a ticket at a live concert.
- I just want to know where the bodies are buried. Those poor families deserve closure!
- What is it that's so appealing about Garth Brooks? I remember his concert got cancelled a few years ago here in Ireland and it honestly brought the country to its knees for a few weeks. Scandal of the year
- plus his movies have a certain style, for some people that style has gotten stale or went out of fashion, if that makes sense
- I just finished watching all of the Showa, Heisei and Millennium runs and while some were excellent and some were rough (Godzilla’s Revenge being a real struggle), the recent Godzilla did an excellent job of putting the American spin on the character. They’re all popcorn flicks and movies to have fun watching.
- Well, except Godzilla’s origins were in a much more serious film with real themes and messages. 

It’s fine to enjoy the movie, but the viscerally negative reaction that the fandom had to those who didn’t was embarrassing. They were so hyped up on the sheer idea of a movie that would finally get Godzilla “taken seriously” in the West* that the prevailing opinion quickly became “Godzilla movies not only can but SHOULD be nothing but dumb fun, and anyone criticizing KotM for the poor (and very prominent) human story is *missing the point* because ALL THESE OTHER Godzilla movies have shitty human stories.” Yeah, many (even most!) are low-budget fluff, but to begrudge anyone who wants something more out of the franchise - especially given its origins, and ESPECIALLY only three years after a more serious thematic entry took Japan by storm after a decade of total public disinterest and another decade of nothing - is nonsense. 

——————————————————---------------------------------—

*Never mind that Godzilla as a franchise has always been taken about as seriously in the West as it had in Japan: broad cultural icon with an original highly-respected if sorta-niche film with most others beloved by children and as nostalgia artifacts.
- Just leave Charles Dance saying “long live the king”.
- The wires snapping and the rain on the windshields get my blood pumping. It's imprinted on my mind. I think that's what I want playing at my funeral.
- Arnold's perfectly chiseled ass throwing a dude on a hot stovetop? Practical.
- Movies with practical effects always seem to hold up better.  It's like our brains are comfortable with reality based leaps,  but the uncanny valley seems to grow with years between watching for cgi effects.
- They had to use practical effects, though they were called the more traditional “special effects” back then. CGI was just coming into existence as a term in the industry, and ILM’s animators worked doubly hard both to design and render just a few on-screen seconds of the metallic T-1000 morphing back and forth.  The computing power barely existed

If this film were produced now, much of T2s “practical” effects would 100% be rendered in computer software, since it’s cheaper and faster. Many CGI shots in movies nowadays (of course not all) are rendered beautifully and seamlessly with live-action; the audience never notices the difference. A good example is simple cars in the background in a typical highway chase sequence.
- Jeez, anything will look good if you compare it to that steaming pile.
- Or the CGI Monkies from Jumanji

- >the visual and audio effects in Star Wars were revolutionary in many ways and helped pave the way for better effects in other movies; something 2001 didn’t do at all.

I beg your pardon? 2001 absolutely did pave the way for effects in cinema, some of the techniques used in 2001 such as it's space photography were practically carried over to Star Wars.

 Many of the techniques it pioneered are still used to this day, as far as special effects go its universally considered one of most influential films in cinema history, it is possible for the influence of both Star Wars and 2001 to run parallel with each other.
- >They may look like they could have been made at the same time, but while Space Odyssey used almost exclusively tried and true methods, the visual and audio effects in Star Wars were revolutionary in many ways and helped pave the way for better effects in other movies; something 2001 didn’t do at all. Many of the scenes in Star Wars were technically more complex than anything in 2001 and could never have been achieved with the same techniques and technology.

You're not being totally fair here. Lucas himself has admitted to cribbing techniques from 2001.
- >Star Wars were revolutionary in many ways and helped pave the way for better effects in other movies; something 2001 didn’t do at all.

That's actually not true. 2001 pioneered motion control,  which is what Star Wars ran with. Check out this video.

- Those usually aren’t in real time, at least most of the performances I’ve seen haven’t been. That’s why they’re able to run trailers for them if you’re talking about stuff like “fathom events”
- I’ve paid for boxing ppv’s. They charge $20 per person. $100 for a concert is ridiculous, but to each their own. I guess I can pack out my van with 8 ppl and we could split it.
- Totally, except this is price per car, not per person. One sedan with 4 people in it, reduces this to $25 a head. Which is too much for me to go see Garth Brooks but is otherwise within a realm of reasonableness.
- The only place I'd ever watch a Garth Brooks concert is Falcon Car Wash.
- I'm not a huge country fan anymore, but when I was a kid (in the 90s) he was HUGE.  Garth Brooks was the soundtrack to my childhood.  He had a zillion hit songs.  

I've never been to one of his shows, but apparently they are epic and he is an amazing showman.  He did a 5 day stay in Nashville a few years ago and I know people that loved it so much they went more than once.  

If you are/were a country music fan 30 years old or older Garth Brooks is ubiquitous with country music.
- Charles Dance's "[long live the king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVDtmouV9kM&t=2m6s)" is right up there with Ken Watanabe's "[let them fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocoxyMuXg8&t=28s)" as such iconic lines of the new movies.
- Where’s the goat?
- [deleted]
- Or how you can't upscale and re-release CGI (Yet....).  All the music videos from the 90's that use CGI are stuck at 480p resolution :c
- Practical effects are timeless while Pre 2010 cgi is most certainly not. Nowadays lot people can't distinguish between cgi and noncgi due to how far the technology has come, but I always miss the times where the cgi was not good enough or didn't exist at all. It meant the FX guys had come up with some incredible inventions to make movies. The hydraulic Trex in jurassic Park is still one of the most amazing movie props to date!
- Or most of the CGI in Crystal Skull.
- Or Air Force One crashing into the ocean in Air Force One.
- I think it's the first use of the "computer screen projected onto the face of the user" trope (when Bowman is in the pod). That is used in so many movies and TV shows now.
- Event Horizon is one of my favorite horror movies and I know many others agree, I can understand why some would dislike it but it definitely didn't suck.
- Hang in there, both of you. There's good stuff around the corner.

I just presume they use footage from previous live events, like every other live event.
- They can, as evidenced by the Mayweather/McGregor fight. But yeah, I looked and this one is pre-taped because of multiple time zones/dusk times.
- Here in France some cinema chains do live theatre/ballet/spectacle brodcasts. Well, this year obviously it's been difficult and some of them were pre-recorded or just cancelled, but usually it's real time.
- Its variable. about 9/10 fathom events are pre-recorded, but then they pull something outta left field like that live mayweather vs mcgregor fight in 2017.
- Fill that car aaaall the way up
- I'm the GOAT.
- And delicious.
- CGI is best for things in the background.  Like Mad Max Fury Road has CGI in every shot, but it is just removing mountains, or adding smoke, things you don't directly look at.

==================================================
Post Title: Jurassic Park is just as good today as it was 26 years ago
Author: bipidiboop
Score: 22476
Content:
My daughter has never seen this so it was my responsibility to once I remembered. 

Every iconic scene holds up. Every dinosaur holds up. The practical effects were too real for my daughter to think it wasn't a real dinosaur. The limited CGI in the film destroys contemporary films' efforts.   


If it's been a while for you I recommend giving this another watch.

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- Agreed.  It's just an awesome movie.  The Attenborough character is so interesting.  All the performances are great especially from him and Jeff Goldblum.   The fact that there were just a few minutes of CGI is amazing.
- The part where they first see the dinosaurs from the Jeep when they get to the park is one of my favorite movie scenes of all time. The music paired with their reactions to the dinosaurs gives me all the feels. Love this movie.
- And you've gotta love Mr. DNA!
- Neither of the sequels come close to the visual effects of the first one. The first one is also the only real one that is a thriller (IMO).
- I know 3D is nearly dead (if not completely), but that's the best use of 3D I've seen on a home setup.  My TV is on its last legs but that movie is the one I show people that have never seen home theater passive 3D - it's fantastic.
- It really does hold up pretty well today. I mean it doesn't hurt that it's far and away the best movie of the franchise but I still find myself watching it when I come across it on tv. It's fun and that T-Rex crushing the suvs scene is still brilliant and looks pretty good on screen. Rip the goat.....
- Breaking news. Universally beloved movie still loved.
- The thing about the original that differs from the sequels is that Spielberg put the special effects shots (both CG and practical) in *when they were needed.*  

A lot of movies seem to put them in because someone said "and wouldn't it be cool to put (fill in the blank) in the movie because that would be so awesome?"

The effects shots weren't for show.  They weren't there for the sake of having a cool effects shot or sequence.  They were there to serve the story.

A lesser director would have had the T-Rex bust through the fence right away so the audience would be impressed with the shot.  Instead, Spielberg went with a glass on the dashboard vibrating from the approaching dinosaur.  Then he went to the broken fence.  Then - once he'd built up the suspense - the reveal happened.  

I'm pretty sure he learned this from "Jaws."  Due to problems with the primitive practical effects shark, he couldn't reveal it right away.  He had to **imply** the shark.  You didn't really see the whole thing until Brody is spooning chum off the back of the boat and then it's a "holy shit" moment. 

That's one of the great things about Jurassic Park.  You don't get the dinosaurs until you need to see them.  When you do, it hits you harder because you've been prepared to be amazed.
- I was 11 years old when Jurassic Park hit theaters. I begged my Mom to take me to see it every weekend. We eventually saw it three times in theaters, and every time it was breathtaking. To this day I have yet to watch a film 3 time in theaters.

I now have a 6 year old Daughter. This post has inspired me to have a movie night on Friday where we watch this together.

I’m so excited. Thank you for the inspiration.
- Jurassic Park was the first movie I ever saw in a cinema, I'll never forget that experience... A true classic in every sense of the word
- Practical fx is king. Actors worked their whole lives to actually act, not look at a dot in a green studio.
- jurassic park is the best adventure film ever made.   it is a benchmark that all other adventure films should be judged by

- If you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It pairs so well with the film, and adds SO MUCH content to the movie's story.
- Favourite film of all time.

Truely timeless and masterful.

Spielberg is unparalleled.
- The first one is so good that I keep coming back to each sequel, hopeful and excited... and then disappointed.
- /r/moviescirclejerk

i swear its the same fucken topics and movies over and over and over, now waiting for 2001 a space odyssey
- And Jurassic World is just as bad today as it was 4 years ago.
- Yep, and still relevant. IT professionals are still overworked and underpaid... and yet people act all surprised when disaster strikes.
- They do travel in herds....
- I’m my opinion it’s a classic! I watch it a few times a year 🦖🦕
- The score. You forgot about the score! The score in that movie is also absolutely breathtaking. It really introduces how grand and special the dinosaurs are. 

Fun fact: my wife and I walked down the aisle to the Jurassic Park theme song (piano guys version).
- The moment the T-Rex roars at Alan and his flare, in the pouring rain, will stay with me as the most terrifying few seconds in film.

[Look at this fucker.](https://tenor.com/view/jurassic-park-trex-flare-dinosaur-rawr-gif-3297825) It's the eyes that get me.
- Jurassic park is always the number 1 movie I’m showing my future children since it scared me so much as a child
- It’s one of my favorite movies, I’m 31 and my favorite dinosaur is the Triceratops.
- I think Spielberg has always been a master of pushing special effects technology as far as it can go, but not an inch further. Later Jurassic Park movies with thousands of dinosaurs, close-up CGI, etc - are technically more impressive than the first one, but they don't look real. 

Spielberg is also a master at hiding the monster, which use to be a standard technique, then CGI came along and let you have the monster just hang out on screen for 30 minutes and it becomes less fearsome.

The raptors in the kitchen scene in the first one is just a perfect sequence in every way - the kids' performances, the balance between seeing and anticipating the raptors, etc.
- 1990's memories. Babysitters show up for date night, blah blah chitchat, "we're going to Jurassic Park." Kids overheard, lost their shit thinking we were going to see real dinosaurs without them.
- 90% Practical and 10% CGI is the absolute perfect ratio. I think that was something Peter Jackson was into (before The Hobbit Trilogy, obv)
- Does anyone know the word for the overall feel of the world?  Aesthetic perhaps?  I feel like my entire childhood was influenced by the 'taste' of jurassic park.  It was the gold standard for what "modern" looked like and everything from clothes to school books to building design kind of imitated it for a while.
- An Unforgettable Experience is packed with the movie, always a Childhood Classic for me.
- thanks to this damn movie,  I always gotta say it as "dino-saw"
- I saw it a few weeks ago at the Hollywood bowl. It's still great.
- I felt the same way watching "The Thing" recently.
- Great movie!  I recently read the book for the first time and I really enjoyed it.  It’s more into the horror genre than the movie, if that’s what you’re into
- I went and saw it in a theater recently and had forgotten how great it was. Seeing it in a theater was next level.
- You could say the same for T2 from the same era.
- Spared no expense.
- It’s a timeless movie. I used to watch it just for nostalgia.
- https://i.imgur.com/EufL9RI.gifv
- Check out the book if you enjoyed the film. Jurassic Park is one of my wife's favourite films. She read the book this year and absolutely loved it.
- Timeless, good call.  The shot of the t-rex roaring in the headlights and red light of the flare after Grant runs out *toward* it ("HEYYY!") is one of my favorite shots of all time. It is fking TER-RI-FY-ING, with and without context, gives goosebumps every time.  [Pause at the second or two around 1:22-1:23](https://youtu.be/nBRQv8hDQmQ).




That whole attack scene is interesting too.  I'm not sure if it was intended this way or not, but it seemed like Malcolm and Grant were watching the rex attack the car with a veeery dark curiosity, wanting to see what this incredible animal, extinct for tens of millions of years prior, would do next. Not necessarily *allowing* it to happen and the kids almost becoming dino shit, but alllllmost lol.  Or they were simply in shock, freezing up watching and thinking "wtf could we possibly do right now to help??". I like to think the former though, it's a bit darker but feels right.
- damn this subreddit sucks
- Same with Starship Troopers.
- Saw it in theaters when I was six, I was absolutely blown away.
- I hate 3d but the kitchen scene I'm 3d is bad ass and takes it to a whole new level. 
Seriously the best JP movie and far and away better than any JW movie.
- As someone who cannot stand the sequels (I seriously hate the two Jurassic Worlds,) the movie's dedication to creating characters you care about really sets it apart. For what is essentially a monster movie it's brilliant at that aspect.
- There’s a cool video on YouTube explaining why Spielberg likely shot it in the aspect ratio he did and why it’s so effective:

https://youtu.be/BKALxKbjOaE
- The original is a masterpiece. The sequel was OK since it still borrowed some from the novels but was still inferior to the original. The next films were just absolute trash. The most recent one was entertaining because it didnt come off as ridiculous as the first Chris Pratt one but it was still a shitty CGI mess.

Reminds me of the new trailer for the Terminator. That looks like a shitty Syfy movie yet the first 2 films still look great...and they're older than Jurassic Park.
- Honestly, it's a great movie.

Until you read the book.

Hammond being killed by his hubris and his creation at the end is *the point*. It's like changing your ending to *I Am Legend*. It's senseless as it's integral to the story.

The character of Alan Grant was changed wildly. It's fine, but it's not quite right. Same with Ellie Sattler.

They cut large portions of the book.

The sequel is even worse. They got Chricton - who never did sequels and hated them - to write a great sequel and then ignored all of it.

Instead of more garbage *Jurassic World* films, I'd love to see the first two books made into four faithful films. Or two seasons of an HBO show. 

They deserve it.
- Unfortunately Jurassic World and JW2 are very forgettable.
- UNDERRATED GEM!!!!!
- Jurassic Park is trash
- I watched it recently at the Royal Albert hall in London, with a live orchestra doing the score. Fave me goosebumps and made me tear up several times.
- It’s testament to what clever use of CG can do. It may not hold a candle in terms of the model or textures to modern CG, but they worked with the limitations to make it blend in with the practical effects.

Corridor Crew discussed it in one of their videos and it isn’t so much that the CG is technically great in contrast to today’s CG, rather it was cleverly used to blend in whereas modern films are often overrun by CG which then feels lifeless due to it lacking any real-world reference.
- Let’s not forget that this movie massively advanced our knowledge of dinosaurs too. Spielberg wanted it to be as scientifically accurate as possible, so the research community suddenly had cash from a Hollywood movie budget to further their research.
- Jurassic Park is smart in how it shows its dinosaurs. They're either far away or obscured in shadow, or it cuts away before you take in too much. Jurassic World is almost pornographic in the way it shows off its CGI, it has these long takes with continual action in daylight or well-lit night scenes, they are very proud of what they've done but don't see how less is more. 

Less is more in film as a rule, but especially when it comes to things that aren't real. The longer you allow your audience to take something in that they know isn't real, the more they will analyze it and break their immersion. It's best to obscure it a little, or to use practical effects so the actors can be there reacting to the thing, proving to the audience that yes, this is real. Modern film doesn't try hard enough to fool our instincts. 

Best of all though, the movie respects its audience's need for genuine feelings. There is conflict on a level of not just bad guy versus good guy. There's two people deciding if they want to have kids. There are kids going through their parent's divorce finding a surrogate pair of parents during a crisis. There's a scientist debating a businessman on his ethics and the nature of scientific discovery. The greed of a corporate mole versus the purity of a man with vision. It's not just so simple, it never acts like the audience is stupid. Contrast that with the mustache-twirling modern villains of the franchise, and it feels downright condescending by comparison.
- One of the greatest movies in cinema history.  It will still hold up in 2119
- Such a bold statement....
- Nothing - nothing, in a movie makes me feel the way that the Jurassic Park theme does. It takes me back to being 12 years old instantly.
- Same with the horror film  "the thing"
- My favorite movie of all time.
- Spared no expense.
- Favorite movie of all time. If it’s ever on tv, I stop to watch it.
- One of my favorite John Williams movie scores
- I waited on Steven Spielberg once. I wrote Thanks for Jurassic park and Animaniacs on his bill.
- Going to see it this weekend with symphony orchestra playing the score live. I'm so excited
- One of the best movies of all time imo. Pretty much perfect in my eyes and a film you can rewatch over and over.
- It’s my favorite movie, along with Jaws. I watch it regularly at least every few months (it’s always on TV.) It’s perfect. 

I also go see it in the movie theater every once in awhile if there’s a special showing.
- Can we all agree that not only is JP an amazing film, but none of the sequels even come close.  The other JP films were sloppily made at best and the Jurassic world films are just cgi monster maybe garbage.  But the original, oh man, the original.  That is a beautifully made cerebral thriller.
- I was 12 when I first saw it in an old classic theater in Santa Barbara - with (off limits) upper mezzanine to screen left and right.

My brother and I snuck upstairs and onto the left mezzanine in the first 20 minutes. It was rickety as fuck, but that only enhanced the danger of the whole experience of seeing dinosaurs move like that for the first time.

Definitely the best movie experience of my life.

Jurassic Park also made me a life long Crichton fan. I started reading "real" books after that.

That movie basically changed my life.
- Never get tired of the first Jurassic Park. It’s brilliant.
- Timeless classic. On the big screen is unbelievable.
- I got a pirate copy of it a few months before it got released from in the UK (1993) on VHS video and it was done with a camcorder at the back of the cinema from the states, it was all green and could hardly see anything with much clarity.
When I got to see it at the cinema it blew me away, hands down one if the best films I've seen and one of my favourite films too. 
Remember watching how they were set to go with stop motion dinosaurs then ILM came in and were like yeah, look what we can do!
- Steven Spielberg directed the hell out of that movie. To be fair the script was passable without being great but Spielberg didn’t just turn up and lend his name for a big payout - he really knocked it out of the park.
- the book is also awesome for those who haven’t read it. it’s got more detail than the movie obviously and has more of a horror vibe, but Spielberg captured it insanely well on screen.
- Is there an edit where the kids are removed from the movie? That would be great.
- I'll bounce it right back to you: Jurassic Park was never good in the first place. The only it had going for it is the visual effects. The script is absolute trash, and the characters' reactions to  threat makes absolutely no sense. Throughout the movie, it feels like they're purposefully trying to get killed by making stupid decisions (who the fuck turns on a flash light when there is a FUCKING T REX next to your car?? Adrenalin makes your senses sharper and your reactions faster, it doesn't turn you into a mindless chicken). 

Most overrated POS movie ever made.
- I feel the same with the Lord of the Rings trilogy,  the only thing comparable was the good seasons of game of thrones, even then Lotr had better acting.
- It's a well made film and still the best of the series. Music, cinematography (Spielberg thinks of lots of clever angles and shots), and even a good solid script. 

No one is quoting Jurassic Park III or Lost World. I can't even remember any notable lines. We still quote many lines from JP1.

Also, like Jaws, the dino craziness actually doesn't happen until much later, the same way Bruce the shark doesn't actually do his thing until later (although technically there's a brief attack scene in the very beginning of both though). But I think this helps develop the characters and everything feels more real.

Compared to other movies where most of the undeveloped cast feel cheap and expendable.
- When Jurassic World was coming out I was really excited we were going to get a look at the dinos from the keeper's perspective vs. how the outside world was going to use them.  It had the barest bit of that and then the rest was a plotless nightmare.  Also, pro-tip, all animal enclosures should have two sets of gates, especially if they can turn invisible. :P
- In other news, water is wet!
- Yeah, the CGI is simply amazing especially for its time. This scene still blows me away: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQB1IvIDgRc
- The Spielberg documentary on HBO a year or two ago really showed how much of the CGI in the movie was a game changer. When they first saw the images of the dinosaurs, everyone was blown away.
- The fact that there's only 6 minutes of CGI in a 2 hour movie is absolutely nuts when you think about it.
- TIL Richard Attenborough and David Attenborough are brothers.
- And the music OMG!
- Story build reveal. I remember the teaser was just the Trex foot coming down in the mud. No spoilers, just that. As a 10 year old? Holy smokes.
- It’s got so much magic. I feel like I’m watching it for the first time every time I see it
- 4 minutes, it's unbelievable.
- The music, though. It's the music that ties everything together.
- Amazing also they almost cut Goldblums character completely!

It’s such an amazing cast with fx that look better than stuff released this year over two decades later, it’s crazy!
- >The Attenborough character is so interesting

Absolutely. Seeing a rich entrepreneur who wants to share something magical with the world without really understanding the consequences of what he's brought forth is just amazing.
- I think any movie that has the philosophy where they’re trying to make a movie that’s compelling without CG and then add CG on top of it is going to be successful.
- CGI tends to ruin movies. This is back when it was new so they kept it to a minimum. Now they’re all talking to tennis balls and it’s fucking ridiculous.
- That there's only a few minutes of CGI is why the film holds up so will. The CGI is pretty poor and stands out like a sore thumb.
- It was the first movie I seen in the cinema as a child and man it was such an unbelievable experience. My daughter is not even 2 yet but she loves dinosaurs and I know she’s too young but I’m so tempted to sit her down and watch it with her.
- Easily in my top10 movies of all time.  The 3D version is shockingly pretty good too.
- There is more then most people think on stuff you don't even notice
- On the music specifically, I got to see John Williams live in concert and it was just the coolest experience. They played this scene on a screen with the live orchestra. Chills all the way.

"Without John Williams, bikes don’t really fly, nor do brooms in Quidditch matches, nor do men in red capes. There is no Force, dinosaurs do not walk the Earth, we do not wonder, we do not weep, we do not believe."

Steven Spielberg
- Agreed. I watched it again not long ago after having not seen it for awhile and that scene still blows me away.  I can't believe how well the movie holds up.
- That scene made me fall in love with Laura Dern.
- This 100%, but I'm not going to lie, I'm also just very thankful it gave us that edit that I think originated from YTMND.

*Holy fuck-ing shit it's a di-no-saur, Jesus christ, what the fuuuu-uuuuuu-uuuuuck*
- [deleted]
- Am I the only one who genuinely gets chills during that scene?

I wish I’d been able to see it in the cinema.
- You had to see that scene on the big screen though. A true movie theater movie is there ever was one
- ERB said it as a diss, but it's kinda true, half of Spielberg's awards are due to John Williams.
- Absolutely. This scene and the movie overall never get old.

Love me some Jurassic Park!
- DAII-NO-SOR-US
- MR. KAMIKAZE!
- Hello John
- The way John says it, it sounds like "Mr DNEEEE."
- [Bienvenidos a Jurassic Park!](https://youtu.be/0-YWxhRN4iI)
- Are these characters auto-erotica?
- "Misteh Deedledee! Where did you come from?"

Took me YEARS in my childhood to get what he was saying.
- More than the effects, the stories in the sequels made very little sense. But then again, Jurassic Park was originally planned to be a standalone movie and they cut a lot of elements from the books out. And they had to scramble to make a story that would make sense in the sequels and it was  hodgepodge.
- I still firmly believe the only good film out of all 5 is the original. One great film and the rest range from mediocre to horrendous
- [deleted]
- > Neither of the sequels come close to the visual effects of the first one. 

err i am guessing you haven't seen the lost world in a while then because this is objectively wrong . no offence.
- Lost world had better effects, don't lie. it was a worse movie for sure.
- I don’t even remember what the second one was, but I think 3 was pretty good. World was meh at best, but what ever is after that one is just flat out horrible.
- I really enjoyed this video about why the first movie is so successful.

https://youtu.be/BKALxKbjOaE

- It's the same fate shared by the Matrix sequels, and every Terminator film after T2: there is no way to break as much ground as the film that came before.
- I saw it in 3D in the theater, when it had that limited release a few years back.

Best 3D film I have seen in the theater. Period.
- I got into watching 3D movies in VR recently, it's like having your own IMAX cinema. It's a pity VR started taking off just as studios started ditching 3D movies, since it's a great matchup, but there's no good software to view them without a lot of tinkering.

JP3D is without a doubt still the best I've watched, the shot compositions are perfect for the format- a clear example is the T.Rex breakout. Very clear foreground (cars) midground (Rex) and background jungle, creating incredible parallax. I freeze framed on that moment in awe, it's a hell of a conversion.

And 3D's not *quite* dead. King of the Monsters came out on Blu Ray 3D this year, though it doesn't hold a candle to Jurassic Park.
- Can I come over?
- 3D got a bad rep at home because all the early implementations sucked, and were primarily the active-shutter variety with those heavy battery-powered glasses that give you a headache. It wasn’t until much later that passive (like at the movie theater) took off, and by that point people were turned off.

I’m lucky enough to have one of the last 3D TVs in the market and it’s a 65” OLED. Home 3D is wonderful. Gravity in 3D with PITCH blacks is life changing.
- IIRC this was even screened as 3D in some movies back in the days, you know when you still bought those one-time-use 3D glasses with just a red and a blue glass and compared to the shit that we had the last couple of years, seeing the original JP in 3D was an upgrade but todays movies seeing in 3D is just a nuisance.
- probably because due to excessive amount of care that was put into it (just like the 3d conversion of "Titanic" is said to be absolutely stunning as well).
- Jurassic Park and The Princesses Bride are the 2 movies that I will stop whatever I’m doing and sit down and watch if I stumble on it while it’s playing on TV.
- WHERE'S THE GOAT
- In that scene, as doors open and the camera moves around, you can sort of keep hearing the goat. There's a point before they see that it's gone that you stop hearing it. Everything in that scene is just ramping up the tension. Perfect scene.
- Ikr

Every so often someone will make a post about a movie that is already universally agreed as amazing and the poster will proclaim how great it still is. Thats nice... We know.
- made by Universal Pictures.
- [deleted]
- I cringed so fucking hard when I read this title. Like yeah, no shit it still holds up.
- Have you ever heard of this hidden gem called Jurassic park?
- Yeah... I'm not sure why this is on the front page. Big news right?
- This just in. OP's mum loves this film.
- That's why alien works so well too. They just build the suspense up and up, with either glimpses or no view at all of it, then when you finally do see it complete it's hugely impactful
- You really think this movie is suitable for a 6-year old? Tell me how it went. 😂
- [deleted]
- Not that you asked for it but heres my story... 

I went to see a matinee with my mom on her day off. We were in a small town so it was basically just us in there. I remember getting up and hiding by the door for parts of the trex scene because it scared me. I loved it so much when we left we went to K-mart across the street and she offered to buy me a Jurassic Park toy, instead I talked her into spending the money on another ticket because it was the same price and we watched the next showing right away. 

Looking back I realize how annoying that must have been but she didn't complain and its one of my favorite memories with her. She was the best mom a kid could have. 

We just passed the 2 year anniversary of her passing to breast cancer last week. The theme music always brings me right back to that day. Jurassic Park will always hold a special place in my heart and I watch it whenever I need to think about better times.
- To this day, the only movie where I saw the audience clap at the end. Being a 12 year old, I thought that's what all adults do at non-PG movies.
- That's funny. I love the film but it's a benchmark of my feeling old.  
I was managing a little gift shop that year. Two friends got tickets on opening night for the movie. I hustled to close up shop and we ran (literally) to the other end of the mall to get there on time. During the Rex/Jeep scene I realized I was still wearing a fucking tie.  
What kind of damn "groan-up" wears a tie to an adventure film? (grin)
- I remember it being SO loud. You almost had to cover your ears when the dinosaurs roared.
- My brother and I *begged* our parents to let us see it in theaters, but we were pretty young and even though we had dinosaurs on the brain, they held firm. When it was released on VHS, they picked it up and we watched it from the security and relative comfort of our living room.

Didn't matter too much - I had nightmares well into my teens and to this day, any time I walk into a new room I'm silently assessing potential Velociraptor (or rather, Deinonychus) entry points.

Hands down, my favorite movie of all time and as far as I'm concerned, the T-Rex standing between the two cars and roaring is the most terrifying moment in cinema history.

edit: As an afterthought - when it was re-released in theaters a few years ago, it was a dream come true. That T-Rex roar was meant to be heard in theaters.
- [deleted]
- It’s funny because this film is considered to be a pioneer of CGI
- This is such a weird sentiment. Why is it only acting when another person is involved? I would think a good actor would be able to do their scene regardless of the set or other supporting actors.
- I personally enjoyed the first Mummy as a great adventure film.
- Raiders of the Lost Ark. 

Jurassic Park is fucking awesome but if adventure film is the category then Raiders wins for me.
- Back to the Future is up there too
- The Godfather may be a really old movie but seriously guys it still holds up. You could even say it’s a hidden gem that no one talks about anymore

/s
- [deleted]
- of course ironically, at least at first glance, the majority of posts in that subs actually mostly seem to be about movies that *aren't* that big or frequently brought up.
- This. The CGI has definitely aged. I think people easily confuse the sfx as a whole with the CGI, or simply forget the ropey bits. It's still amazing though.
- And there's a frame where the raptor disappears when the t-rex eats it at the end

Whoops

[You can't see it that well even if you are looking for it though] (https://youtu.be/sKykaIlC9C4)
- The raptor fight still looks great to me, it's the Brachi and stampede that are problematic because they're presented in such flat, well-lit lighting conditions. The main road attack visual effects are amazing to this day, even on blu ray 3D, largely due to good cinematography. 

There's a lot that many modern movies (including the later Jurassic Worlds) could learn from JP... exercising restraint for one, and not relying on texture detail to sell an effect. There's scales on scales on top of scales with JW's raptors, still doesn't stop them looking like glossy cartoons in most shots.
- I agree, the CGI is really poor compared to contemporary cgi of some quality. Details are poor, lighting is unrealistic, sure, good for 93, bad compared to today.
- Watching JP1 in HD on a large modern TV quickly shows the CGI's age. It's still great but things I didn't notice before became obvious.

At least they did a pretty good job trying to hide the CGI's flaws unlike early 2000s CGI which was often shamelessly thrown into the movie's centerpiece.
- [deleted]
- They Shall Not Grow Old.
- The book is incredible. Really well done. Some very tense chapters!
- After I saw it 10 year old me told my dad it was the best movie ever made.  He conceded saying it was top five.
- Sure, the effects are impressive both for the time and in general. But this is also a clinic in pure filmmaking and storytelling.
- Ian Malcolm said it the best. "Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."

Replace scientists with studios and bam.. you have current hollywood cgi
- star wars a new hope still holds up, good sci fi!

DAE man from uncle underrated?

The Arrival is MINDBLOWING scifi cinema!!!

(Insert random animated movie) is a masterpiece, why does it not get talked about more?
- Yup I swear this exact same thread pops up and get 10k+ upvotes and gold every 6 months
- Yeah 21000 upvotes for just saying a very popular opinion is nuts.
- I don't know, JW2 makes it look... less bad... in comparison.
- They need to use the magic word
- They need to start treating us software people better... I could rip this place off bigtime.  Bigtime.
- They're moving in herds. They do move in herds.
- I'll never forget how many tries it took me as a little kid to get through Jurassic Park without hiding behind my chair.
- You and Steven Spielberg have something in common then.
- My now 19 year old son had to watch it everyday at lunch when he was a toddler, he’d hold his toy gun and crouch behind the coffee table slowly eating his grilled cheese. Cracks me up even now thinking about it. I know it’s probably too scary but he woke up from his nap one day and was standing behind the couch watching it before I noticed and he made it a point after that to watch it all the time also Lion King was his jam too.
- Why did you capitalize certain phrases in that comment?  ... It's almost like you copied them from somewhere... ಠಿ_ಠ
- [deleted]
- Arguably Starship Troopers got *better* with time, as the world strangely got a bit closer to the one portrayed in the movie.
- Yeah? Havent seen that in AGES but loved it back in the day. It still holds up?
- That's a great one. Fingers crossed Jurassic World 3 ditches anamorphic and goes back to regular 1:85. Monster movies wanna appear epic by going wide as possible, but it just makes everything tiny onscreen.
- The books were interesting because it showed what happens when capitalism cuts corners.
- I saw JW2 for the first and last time yesterday, might be the shittiest movie I've seen in years! Bad script, poor dialogue and shitty over the top action that comes of more boring than exciting.
- I think it’s in the version where the dinosaurs have feathers.
- Why? Tim and Lex were awesome, especially when you compare the latter to the book version.
- "Alan!"

-Velociraptor, JP3
- My mom has told me about how she still remembers her reaction to seeing the dinosaurs in that iconic scene for the first time. She -- and everyone else -- couldn't believe they could actually do that in a movie. You're right. Completely blown away.
- [deleted]
- Yes. 

It came out in 1993. If you look at something like Jumanji that came out in 1995 and see how poor the CGI is for the monkeys and other animals then it just shows how far ahead JP was at the time.
- That was a great documentary. I didn't really know much about his personal life always saw him as a larger than life figure. Interesting to see how much of his personal issues had an effect on his movies
- And how long they spent on getting it right

Something like 3 years of development just to get the cgi to a place where they felt comfortable including it. THEN they began the multi-year process of making the movie
- While the CG on a bunch of the dinosaurs hasn't aged well, the T-Rex in the rain scene still looks shockingly amazing - even on the big screen.
- The CGI inspired George Lucas to make the Star Wars prequels as well I believe.
- Link of the documentary please.
- The Terminator 2 [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day#Effects) entry says
>Despite the large amount of time spent, the CGI sequences only total five minutes of running time.

I guess a lot of the special effects were practical effects.
- And it's the perfect fit for that role, is it not?? This movie is a masterpiece
- I hope that the next Jurassic World film has a David Attenborough documentary about the dinos in it.   
Screw it, that can be the film
- May Richard rest in peace
- Lol I never realised they were different people. Just thought British docco guy was in Jurassic Park too
- Isn't that something you would just assume though?
- Da da da, da daaaaa.  Da da da, da daa....
- Then there's The Thing (2011) which was being made into a great film that only used practical effects like John Carpenter's masterpiece, and then the studio forced them to go over all of the effects with CGI in post, making the effects look utterly ridiculous.

Such a disappointment that the film from the 80's visually looks better.
- There were lots of movies and TV shows with shit CGI back then.  We just only remember the good ones.
- I know Reddit loves to masturbate on this topic, but the hyperbole really gets ridiculous after a while.

Practically every movie you see these days has tons, tons more CGI in it than you realize. Loads of TV shows, too. CGI is *everywhere* in movies these days, you just don't notice it because *it's really damn good*.

Most CGI does NOT ruin movies. The rare instances when it does stand out *because* it's so rare.

The fact is, even mundane movies have plenty of shots that utilize CGI, from set dressing to stunt work to backgrounds, adding the perfect blood to someone's face, changing the *weather* in a scene, and loads more.

It's just a tool. That's all it is. It's now a commonly used tool. And while tools can be used badly, for the most part it's a tool that has been used to great effect, to the point where we mostly don't even notice it anymore except in giant action movies.

The anti-CGI circlejerk is really silly at this point.
- CGI in the 90s was relatively basic, so you wouldn't want to use it on a large scale. Jurassic Park used it for establishing shots and small cleanup (my favorite use is that they had to composite Lex's face in the scene where she's getting pulled through the drop ceiling because the stuntwoman looked up at the camera briefly), and T2 used it for stuff that was either obvious (the warped chrome reflections) and cleanup.
- I know the Transformers movies are terrible, but one thing Michael Bay did right was the limited use of CGI. Almost all the destruction and explosions in the background were real. This is why if you watch a battle scene from the Transformers films (e.g., that "forest battle" from Transformers 2), it feels like the robots are actually there in the real world, compared to films like Avengers: Endgame, where the final fight scene looks like a 100% animated film.
- How's life back in the 90s?
- Spielberg was right.  Williams brings it to the next level every time.  

You know, I always think about the initial brachiosaurus scene and the score that goes along with it when I think of the music in Jurassic Park, but today I thought of something that I never considered.  I had to go back and rewatch the scene to see if I remembered correctly: there is no music through the whole sequence with the Tyrannosaurus, and it makes the scene so much more real and terrifying.  I imagined what a modern release of that scene would sound like, and I bet they would spoil it with overly ridiculous music.  What a smart decision by Spielberg.
- I love the story of when Spielberg showed Williams *Schindler's List*.

Williams said to Spielberg, “You need a better composer than I am for this film.” Spielberg responded, “I know. But they're all dead!”
- One of the deaths I truly hate thinking about is John Williams. Whenever I go to the symphony I know he’s going to have his music played in the future like Mozart or Beethoven. 

He’s 87 though so probably will be sooner over later. :(
- John Williams scored big time.
- I worked at a theater during the 3D re-release and during a slow day I watched the scene where the t-rex first gets loose in a completely empty theater. At times I felt like I was alone in the room with a god damn t-rex. It just holds up so well.
- This movie resonates with me because of the women in it. Laura Dern's character is smart, stands up for her (and Allan's) dig at the beginning (she calls Hammond a jerk without hesitation), she gets out of the car to take care of the Triceritops, she shuts Hammond down when he insists a woman shouldn't "go out there" when she wants to restore power to the park. Plus she has that iconic line about women ruling the earth.

And the girl was a "hacker" who engaged the locks to protect everyone (even though all she really does is navigate the file system) but it was still cool for a young girl like me to see both women having roles in fixing the park. Plus the kitchen scene where she outsmarts the dinosaur to save her brother. I just love this movie so much.
- She looks phenomenal in this movie!
- That was easily one of the best YTMNDs.
- I don't even need to click the link to know what it is. For years I've longed to unhear that. I can't *not* think of it whenever I see the scene.
- Great callback to another classic piece of studio history: https://youtu.be/XCPj4JPbKtA
- Thanks.  I hate it. Take your upvote.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vupCgB8H9Og

Still one of my favorites
- I knew what this was going to be before I clicked on it, and I started laughing before I even opened the video. I've seen this so many damn times, and it makes me laugh every single damn one of them.
- It should get a rerelease for its 30th anniversary in my opinion. I still remember going to watch it at the cinema, and again when my parents first invested in surround sound at home. Amazing experiences each time!
- I'm getting chills just reading about it and picturing the scene right now
- I go to the cinema usually only a few times a year and yet when I was 10 years old, both Jurassic Park and Lion King came out and I saw both 5 times in the cinema each. Great year for movies.
- I was 9 when I saw it in theaters. Changed my life. After the initial dinosaur obsession I realized it wasn't that but the love for movies that it ignited.
- I was a kid and saw it when it came out in theatres with my mom.  We were both blown away, it really was groundbreaking at the time.  I watched it with my boys recently and still loved it.
- It's still one of my most cherished memories, being around 12, in that theatre, already obsessed with dinosaurs, watching that scene for the first time. Totally got chills.
- My theater did a flashback cinema series and it was one of the selected films.
- Watched it when I was 7. It really scared me. Then later on in the week, family friends took us the movies. I was excited but didn't know what we were watching and once we were sitting down they told me it was Jurassic Park. I was mortified. Remember closing my eyes during the Trex night scene.
- This was the first movie I ever saw in theaters.  My parents took me to see it at 4 years old.  Not sure what they were thinking but I was thankful
- I'm grateful that my condo building has a theater room. so i got the JP bluray and watched it in there recently. i had never watched the movie on a big screen with a huge sound system, it's truly amazing.
- Three times at the cinema, countless times at home. Still get chills every time.
- And Bingo! Dino, D-N-A!
- It's a veggiesaurus!
- Here to spread some genes!
- hello john
- Spielberg even begged Crichton to write The Lost World so he had a book to adapt for a sequel...he then completely butchered the book, lol.
- I don't remember much about the sequels, but I remember really liking the third and hating the second. I'm really surprised to see that the third one wasn't very well liked.
- I like the second one but mainly out of blind nostalgia. Whenever it comes on tv I’m reminded it’s really not that good
- I gotta admit, I was literally (literally literally, not figuratively literally) confused when you said 5. I had forgotten about the World's, and just mentally didn't connect them to the originals since the thread is about how good the first movie is.
- I'm a huge JP fan (primarily the first) and usually watch it once a year. By far the most recent one (JW2) is the worst of the entire series.
- Couldn't agree more. 

I cannot remember ever being as hyped for a movie as when Jurassic World came out - I had my tickets day one - and the sense of disappointment was profound.
- I’ve never gotten past Lost World. I’d rather pour lemon juice onto several dozen papercuts on and around my eyelids than watch a Jurassic Park sequel.

Lost World couldn’t have been worse if they’d stolen Jar Jar Binks from an early draft of The Phantom Menace.
- I actually slightly disagree with you a little. You’re mostly spot on, but he didn’t “realize the park was fucked”. Obviously he was distraught and wanted ice cream, but in that conversation with Ellie he repeatedly mentions getting control back, to which Ellie flat out says “control is an illusion. You cannot hope to contain this power because you don’t respect it, and if you respected it you never would have done this”. That’s when he realizes his Park is fucked. 

Hammond is shown all through the movie to be a control freak. The first time we meet him he’s controlling the environment by ensuring he’s the one pouring the champagne. He has to be present for every birth on the island. Hell, even after the control speech with Ellie he’s trying to be in control by walking her through the power station bunker even though he has no idea what he’s talking about, at least as far as directions. 

But you’re totally spot on as far as him leaving the freezer door open saves Tims life. I’ve watched the movie a hundred times at least and I never picked up on that!
- Okay so I've seen this movie countless times and it's always been one of my absolute favorites but I've NEVER even thought about that, excellent observation!
- You are blowing my mind right now.
- Second one was hunters followed by T-Rex in the big city.
- [deleted]
- I felt like the third season, even though I enjoyed it, was more of the B-horror that you got in the 80's. It felt more like your Killer Clowns From Outer Space. Still good, just not in the same ballpark.
- It was really good, wasn't it? It was the most I've enjoyed a 3D film. Granted, I was just super happy to see it in theaters
- same here.  It was up there with Avatar as the 2 best movies to make use of 3D.
- Man, I thought to just support the movie, but some of the scenes actually made me jump again in 3D.
- Agreed, all of the movies released around the same time that were purposefully made to be in 3D looked like shit compared to the 20 year old re-release of a 2D movie.
- Sure!  I’d be happy to host.
- Add Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump to that list and its gold!
- I wouldn't mind it too much, but this movie specifically gets posted a lot, saying the same shit every time.

See you again in a few months.
- Took place in the universe.
- Hidden amber.
- Yeah, I’m debating about it with my 8 year old. I might wait until he’s 10.
- I'm sorry for your loss. It sounds like you had a great mom.
- I'm glad you are able to have that memory. 

My father died when I was very young, too young to remember him. I have no memories of him, but I do have a collection of movies he loved, and Jurassic Park is one of the ones he loved most. He had the book too, and his now-tattered copy of that book is one of my most cherished possessions.
- Sorry for your loss man! Your min sounds awesome :)
- You can't suppress 60 years of gut instinct
- The rule of thumb on this movie apparently is that if you can see a whole dinosaur it's CGI. If you can only see part of the dino, it's practical.
- It’s nuts right? Proper use of each medium during the right times made an epic!
- I think for CGI it's Terminator 2, which came out before Jurassic Park did.
- Second one was just as good too.
- Definitely the best adventure film. Jurassic Park feels more like a thriller/sci-fi.
- A Spielbergs choice
- You can’t go wrong with either. I do agree that Raiders takes the edge. My second favorite film, after Lawrence of Arabia.
- I agree that BttF is up there, but is it an adventure genre-wise, though? Always thought of the movies as some sort of SciFi-comedy mash up...
- Well, they probably were at one point (or several) if you search. But most movies are discussed especially big ones that everyone has seen before.
- NAh, JW biggest crime is they don't do much with the camera position to show off the dinos. The dino's look amazing but the camera work is poor.

The best Dino scene all round in JW2 for example is the part where Claire and the Pokémon Trainer guy get stuck in the building and stalked by that  Spino like dinosaur. They actualy do interesting stuff with the camera in that scene.

And in JW1 the IndomRex escape is amazingly well done
- Well he's right. They definitely aren't getting any older right now
- Is it just me or is Hereditary the scariest movie ever made?!?
- AmazingMovie that everyone loves and was a hit STILL HOLDS UP!!!!
- Steven Spielberg is 31?
- I'm 30 but when I was little I went through the same phase for a while. Came home from school every day and put on Jurassic park. Drove my parents crazy demanding any Jurassic park toys they could get their hands on.
- I think he’s being sarcastic by capitalizing the buzz words that all these “hidden gem” posts seem to include.
- No, it didn't.
- Storywise, it depends on how much you enjoy satire. It's right around RoboCop since it's the same director.

Visually, absolutely since it was one of the last movies to use miniatures, which was touched up with a bit of CGI I think.
- And the Velociraptors are the size of chickens.
- I loved dinosaurs as a kid. I cannot put into words the excitement, awe and pure joy I felt when that Brachiosaurus appeared on that movie theater screen. Thrilling for a 12 year old boy back then.
- Christopher Reeve made people believe a man could fly.

Steven Spielberg made people believe dinosaurs were back.
- My husband and I were playing lego jurassic park the other day and said even in lego form that first shot of the Brachiosaurus' gets us a bit emotional 20 odd years later.
- I took my parents to go see the new live action Lion King when it came out. They were completely blown away and couldn't believe me telling them that it was 100% CGI.
- And it still holds up. Wild.
- That was such a clever move by Spielberg. The characters had never seen a dinosaur before - and neither did we as an audience. And then we saw them, and we were as excited as the characters themselves.
- Which one? Dr Grant? Dr Malcolm? Dr Ellie or John Hammond?
- I believe it was just called Spielberg.
- Lloyd in Space: The Movie.
- Ahh Jumanji, watching the movie again as an adult has taught me that some actors can secure the longevity of a movie alone. The CGI is bad but Robin Williams is eternally affable
- I always knew the T-Rex was CG but it was another 15 years later that I learned the upturned car was too. I always thought that thing was on a gimbal!
- Taxi Driver inspired John Hinckley Jr. to shoot Ronald Reagan.

Guess sometimes good movies cause people to do insane things
- Most of the non "melting" scenes were all practical, the bullet holes, the shotgun head split were all Stan Winston, CGI was things like wire removal in the bike stunt sequences, and the t 1000 morphing, So Robert Patrick actually DID outrun a dirt bike while covered in lumps of chromed polystyrene 🤯
- yup, some of which I would have never guessed to be practical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYQMfT6nsQs&
- So... Walking with dinosaurs...
- Woah. What if they made a Jurassic movie that was actually a documentary gone wrong? Could be an interesting twist.
- I’ll say, it’s not like it’s a super common name or anything.
- *Holy fucking shit, it's a dinosaur, Jesus chriiist what the fuuuuuuuck*
- Jurassic Park has two main themes, and they happen to encompass each of the two emotions i'm capable of.   
the adventure theme:   
dun dun dududun! dududun dudun dunnn.  
the sad theme:    
dadada da da. dadada da da. dadadaaa daa da daaaaa.
- That sounds like the CGI wasn’t planned for at all.
- Hey don't ruin their circle jerk buddy, super rude!

I'm with ya though, the 'CGI ruins movies' topic is outdated and doesn't deserve to be revived. People just like to use it as a low-effort critique.

If you see some old houses with shitty paint, are you gonna then look at new houses with good paint and say the paint ruins the house? No, because the paint on the new houses is good. Sometimes you see a new house with bad paint though, and it sticks out in your memory so it might make you think new paint is bad too.. but that wouldn't make any sense.
- The effects for this series don't get enough credit. The fact that you can tell that they figured out where each and every piece goes when transforming is incredible.
- There's a quote from I think Joss Wheden, that music is always there to comfort the audience, even when it's scary or sad - there's a Buffy episode (the body iirc) with no music, and the effect is dramatic.
- Its funny because you flip this in the end scene and it makes the T-rex the defacto hero in the scene.
- I had to use the restroom during the first brachiosaurus scene in the theatre. So I missed it. My first memory of seeing a 3D dinosaur was the T-Rex and it was awesome cause I had no idea that was coming.
- A great composer knows when to let silence do the work.
- Just like Beethoven or Mozart, he will, in a way, live forever.
- Damn, I forgot about that part with the "hacking".  The movie came out when most people didn't even know how to turn a computer on, much less do anything meaningful with it, so you see movies in the early 90's having scenes where kids are doing drag-and-drop operations come off as mindblowing stuff to the adults around them.  It's pretty hilarious.  


Hackers is a true masterpiece of film for that sort of thing.  It's such a terrible movie, but in all the right ways, plus it's got Angelina Jolie and Fisher Stevens hams it up unlike anyone I've seen before.
- Ah yes, Ariana Richards. Pogo stick girl in the greatest B Movie Monster movie reboot of all time, Tremors. She was also  great in Angus.
- I stand doubly offended, both as a Jurassic Park fan and a melodica player.

Don't get me wrong: when I play, I only sound about 1% better than that motherfucker, but I don't inflict it on anyone but myself.
- I assumed it was this https://youtu.be/428IyxSfsls
- The first time I saw this vid, I cried laughing and played it approximately 20 times and sent it to everyone I loved. No video has done that for me since. Idk why
- What is it? No music here
- This one is even better:  [https://youtu.be/lKy0SP8ScAk](https://youtu.be/lKy0SP8ScAk)
- no its the greatest thing ever
- It was re-released for an anniversary prior to the Jurassic World franchise. The success of the re-release is to thank for it.
- John Williams absolutely knocked it out of the park on that one.
- Pretty sure JP was ‘93 and Lion King was ‘94.

Still a good year though!
- 1993 was a fantastic year for 12-year-old me.

Jurassic Park

Groundhog Day

Addams Family Values
- Holy shit, I think the same thing happened to me!
- Ghostbusters was the one that did it for me :) My dad took me to see it one evening after he finished work. It's the first time I remember going to cinema just him and I (as opposed to the rest of the family). Not sure what changed after that but I developed a voracious movie habit :). I was 7 at the time.
- Damn. I was 7 when it came out but there was no way I was going to be allowed to see it.

Watched it at 10. Scared me senseless.

Still occasionally get chased by velociraptors in nightmares.
- Jurassic Park is my favorite movie. I like the book, too, it's equally good and the changes made for the film make perfect sense.

The Lost World is my favorite book between the two, and the film is just straight garbage. It isn't even REMOTELY similar. The only shared scene I recall was the tree-top lookout post. They plot, and even the characters, were all completely different. Crichton might as well have not even written another book.

Seriously though, read The Lost World. It contains a gripping mystery, believable characters (including the kids, for the most part), and two EXTREMELY stressful and thrilling scenes that will leave you out of breath.
- I've never understood why they practically forced him to make a sequel and then not use any of it?
- Both opinions are common but people generally prefer the second one. I guess it helps it was directed by Spielberg unlike JP3.

Personally I really dislike the concept of JP2 and prefer JP3's. Still cool to see a T-Rex rampage on San Diego in JP2.
- That scene in the long grass is pretty badass, though!
- Yeah, my daughter LOVES dinosaurs and the original Jurassic park. Had a movie night with The Lost World for her birthday and everyone was bored and barely paid attention except for the trailer bit and the raptor hunt. Even the T-rex in the city barely made a blip!

Part of the problem is that the actual plot doesn't actually revolve around the *dinosaurs*, they are just an expensive CGI Macguffin.
- [deleted]
- Jurassic Park got me into movies and Jurassic World made me question why i watch movies. When people say movies are getting worse this is what i think of.
- I haven’t seen it because I hated the first JW.

Is it really worse than 3? Cause holy shit
- [deleted]
- [deleted]
- The premise for the second one made sense and to an extent, the setup for the third too, but everything else is fucked.

Jurassic World made absolutely no sense. How the fuck did Hammond secretly decide to pass down and green light a second attempt to create a dinosaur theme park to someone else? Security was as bad as the pilot run, I wonder whose dick did the CEO/director/owner suck to get regulator approval.

And dinosaur as military weapons? What the fuck!?
- You seem to forget girl kicking raptors doing exercises at the bar.
- Oh ya I remember that now, that scene where the trex just goes right through a bus is coming to mind
- 3 was...weird. It was actually going pretty well but they either wrote themselves into a corner or ran out of money and just decided, "fuck it, then the military shows up and saves them."

I remember enjoying it more than the second film until the ending. Unfortunately, the ending is one of the few scenes in the film that I really remember at this point.
- I enjoyed it and felt like I got my money’s worth. I bootlegged the last one and still felt ripped off though.
- That was my feeling exactly. 

I was too young when it came out originally. So it was my first and only time seeing it in theaters as well.
- Those are both amazing films but not ones I could over-watch.
- Observed in a society.
- The CGI artists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
- Many of the T. Rex shots at night are hybrid. They made a full size animatronic T. Rex, but couldn’t get the legs to look right. So they used CGI for the legs, and tweaking the animatronics to look better. [Here’s a blurry picture.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/StanWinstonTRex.jpg)
- But no Benny.
- Blockbuster classified it as action.
- I think it's a brilliant mish-mash of a lot of genres, but it undeniably has some really thrilling action in it. Watching the finale in the movie theatre of Doc trying to fix the cable on the clock as Marty is driving up, and the way it intercuts between the two of them is incredibly tense, and that whole sequence is really well executed.
- That's what I love about these dinosaurs, man. 

I get older, they stay the same age.
- Yeah i loved the satire of it, was really surprised when i saw it at the movies when it first came out, i didnt expect it to be so satirical. Didnt actually know it was by the same director as RoboCop - that explains a lot!
- [deleted]
- I was 7, and I still vividly remember sitting in the cinema watching that movie. I remember the ride home, I remember getting a baseball cap with the logo on the front, I can remember telling my grandparents and uncle about it once we got back. 

I can remember about three things total from my early childhood, and this is one of them. Truly magical that movie was.
- I was twelve too and I went to see Jurassic Park with some of my classmates: it was without a doubt the coolest thing we had ever seen, everyone was blown away - boys and girls.
Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, they didn't overdo it with the CGI and everything else (lighting, sound effects etc) is just perfect.
- I can tell you, it was thrilling for a 32 year old boy back then as well.
- are you me?!
- Ye same, I watched that movie like 20 times in theatres when I was a kid
- I totally remember the awe I felt in that scene. The visuals and the John Williams score are so perfect.

Honestly I still feel the same way when I watched it recently. It really has held up well.
- Man, I was still so fascinated by that Cretaceous leaf I didn't even notice the brachiosaurus til my head was turned aroWait, no, that *was* the movie...
- same here. to me, while obviously being aware it was a special effect, it was pretty much "for the first I can see real dinosaurs!".
- I was 8 when I saw it, had to wait for it to come out on video because my parents wouldn't let me see it in theaters. I was in open mouthed awe over that scene. To this day I still grin like an idiot at that scene.
- I was I think 7 and it made my jaw drop. I'm a 33 year old man and watched it recently and the scene when you see them and the music swells made my eyes water.
- I was 10. I remember the line to the theater going around the block. I remember going back to see it at least 3 more times while it was in the theater. It was such an amazing film.
- It was so perfectly played. The characters sense of awe only magnified ours as we saw that for the first time.
- Sam Neils reaction is fucking perfect
- Ironically, I find that the original Brachiosaurus scene contains the one glaring piece of CGI that has trouble holding up.

All the other stuff is flawless, but because they had to that shot in broad daylight with the Brachiosaurs fully on display via CGI, it's more obvious than any of the other digital effects. It looked amazing in the 90's, and the mood, music and timing are all perfect, but yeah. The actual shot nowadays gives be a bit of a TV vibe.

Everything else though? Perfection.
- And Tommy Wiseau made people believe that Lisa was tearing him apart.
- The animation in the film was spectacular. And I think the cast did an excellent job as well.

I'm not entirely sure what was wrong with it. I felt like the songs were out of place - like they were obstacles they had to check off the list so they could move on to the next scene.

I also think the hyper-realism took away some of the charm.

I didn't hate it, and I'm glad I watched it. And the animation really was incredible. But I don't feel the need to see it a second time.
- Dr Sattler, formally. There's also Dr Wu.
- Don't forget that they also sneakily brought in Linda Hamilton's twin for the scene at the end where the T-1000 morphs into a copy of Sarah Conner!
- open the door, get on the floor.
- And they are similar age, born in UK and have similar voices. I just assumed they were brothers from when I was a child. In fact I don't think I ever had it confirmed, I literally just assumed it my whole life.
- Ah, the good old days of YTMND.

http://jurassicparkwtf.ytmnd.com/
- Why don't they just write music like this, instead of with those stupid clefs and symbols and shit? If they wrote music like this, I would have like 9 grammys already.
- You're absolutely correct, it was a last minute decision.

And the base practical FX looked fantastic in the behind the scenes.
- When Luke fights Vader in Empire Strikes Back, there's no music until he gets his hand cut off.  I never noticed until I saw the movie while a symphony live played the soundtrack.  The lack of music was very dramatic.
- The Body. To this day, it's the only episode of that show I'm too afraid to watch again.
- >flip this in the end scene and it makes the T-rex the defacto hero in the scene.

Which is *exactly* what “Jurassic World” did..lol.
- ["It's an interactive CD-ROM!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ElNHEtvO8)
- I still sing this every time I watch this movie. It will never not have the lyrics
- Me too.
- It's an excellent rendition of the original music score from the film using a more contemporary instrument. I highly recommend listening to it at home at full volume.
- Yeah I saw it in Melbourne IMAX for it's 25th anniversary. I imagine they'll do something similar again, the audience is definitely there for it.
- Everyone responsible for that scene really.
- Yup. Had dinosaur chasing us dreams up to like a few years ago. Fuck, I'm 32!!!
- And the baby T-rex scene in the trailer (or part thereof, at least).
- The scene in the book where they see the camouflaged dinosaurs out in the bushes a bit from where they are hiding gave me the chills.  Nothing really happens, it's just a really well-written scene.
- [deleted]
- I feel like the scene of Pratt riding the motorcycles along the raptors in Jurassic World was a nod to the nest scene in The Lost World novel. I agree, though. Shame we never got a proper adaptation of the book. It was an excellent sequel.
- It has its moments but god damn the story is bad and the characters do so many dumb things even by Jurassic film standards.
- "NO!  DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS" 

\*Proceeds to immediately go into the long grass
- That is the best moments/shot in the whole movie.
- Part of that could have been that she was in a group with a bunch of friends, and social aspects took over the movie.

Any time I ever saw a movie at a birthday party, it was the background noise while we all goofed off. Even in theaters.
- Fat sex offenders in a smoke filled room making movies via a committee driven checklist?
- 3 you can appreciate as a bad B movie and laugh at how silly it frequently is.

JW2 is just awful and a chore to sit through.
- JP 3 has the "Alan!" scene so its damned hard to beat plus Sam Neil is just more entertaining to watch than most other folk in the JP franchise.

BUT JW2 did have some great scenes in it and a lot of humour. If you are a massive JP fan like me you'll enjoy it. If you just like the first one and aren't bothered much about JP2 or JP3 you probably won't like JW2.
- JW2 feels like they gave up on trying to write a coherent scripts and just stuck set-pieces together. Characters have no personality, story doesn't makes a lick of sense and very little is consistent. The movie is just an amusement park ride now with very pretty lights and sounds.
- Only it it is free and the only alternative is hitting yourself in the head with a hammer. I wouldn't pay anything to see jw2.
- Yeah, he was in an absolute state of denial at this point taking about "when we get control" not knowing people are dead, the dinosaurs are all loose and even indirect things like the lawyer sent by the investors being dead.  You know, the investors who were concerned about safety in the park and their guy was killed by a dinosaur.

It's a great scene and really explores how dire things have become.
- I suppose that’s the beauty of movies. Most stuff is open to interpretation!
- Also... the Indoraptor somehow sold for only $43M.

Excuse me?
- I'm with you that a lot of JW didn't exactly make sense other than 'just go with it we're trying to make a fun movie here', but Hammond actually didn't decide anything. InGen was bankrupt, and Masrani Corp bought them. They then decided to build the park for reals and kept InGen around primarily to serve their security needs.

This wasn't explained well, if at all, in the movie. I only know it because I remember reading it in one of their promotional sites in the months leading up to the release.
- Dude get it right.

She first shouts at the raptor to get its attention, then starts doing bar before finally kicking it through a wall onto spikes she didn't' set up earlier.!
- It’s been so long since I’ve watched that movie, but I vaguely remember a bit of a continuity error in that scene. I think the people fly out of the windows before the Rex ever touches it...but I can’t remember.
- They scrapped the original ending and just went with the military conclusion at the last minute. They literally wrote the movie as they filmed it.

For context of how well the whole thing was planned, it originally was about a bunch of teenagers crash landing on the island. They changed it shortly before filming started.

With that in mind it’s a miracle it turned out to be a semi coherent movie

Edit: the original ending had the raptors killing the spino and some other shit. Which would’ve been better.
- "call for help"

It's... ok. JP3 has grown on me with age, the animatronics were great in it and there's some good chases. The script got entirely thrown out just before they started shooting, so they had to graft a new plot around the setpieces they already had. It's better than what they were initially going for (which would have had many more annoying children involved) but the rushed rewrite really shows with how abruptly it ends. It's also the shortest film of the whole franchise.
- I...uh the military was literally the last scene in the movie. That means that you thought literally the other 95% of the movie was good.
- Oh man, I remember watching it as a kid. I remember the really crappy theater I watched it in. It doesn't exist anymore. The movie was so amazing to me that I remember everything about going to see it.
- *James Cameron gets mauled by Andy Serkus in a mo-cap suit*
- They also had a problem with the skin of the animatronic T-Rex soaking up so much water it became impossible to move.  They had to wait until it dried out (often having to speed it up with lots of hair dryers) before continuing shooting.
- I rewatched mummy a while back and was so sure that I'd seen an after credits scene where Benny leaves the tomb alive. Sadly, no. :(
- ...at you here. Or here. Or maybe across the belly...spilling your intestines. The point is: you are *alive* when they start to eat you. So you know, try to show a little respect.
- I was about 7 or 8 too (95-96) and obsessed with dinosaurs, when my grandfather discovered I hadn't seen Jurassic Park and was rightly appalled at my parents for this oversight. So we rented it that afternoon. Apparently I sat through the whole movie with my mouth wide open in wonder.

It's still probably my favorite movie of all time, I watch it every couple of years.
- At 12 or so for me.

The T-rex paddock scene remains the most "shit-your-pants"-ever scene, seen.

Flawless, but the *sound???*  Shit, not even a real T-rex is that intense.
- I remember seeing it with my family when it came out. My youngest sister, about 7 at the time, spent a good portion of the movie hiding under her seat..
- That's funny.. I can't remember much from that age,  but I can remember seeing it in the cinema too 😂
- Haha. I'm 38 now and it still awes me lol.
- Lol. Yes, and every other twelve year old back then lol.
- He also made me believe a man can fuck a womans stomach. Legendary.
- Who?
- You mean White Rose?
- Just don't tell Hugh Jackman that's how the trick is done.
- They used her in a deleted scene as Sarah's reflection in a mirror too (so that Sarah could have a mirror reflection that didn't also show the audience the camera).
- Also the deleted scene where they switch the Terminator's CPU into "learning mode."
- That one was the mind-blown moment for sure! Everyone had seen scenes where people had doubles, but they all looked terrible and didn't match up right. Then T2 drops the most perfect body double scene ever on top of everything else.
- The security guard that uses the coffee machine and is copied, also twins.

Bonus, the scene where Sarah works on terminator's head in front of the mirror, that's no mirror. Ms. Hamilton's sister is in that scene, too.
- Everybody join r/Dinosaurs
- Oh shit, that’s another one I didn’t think of and I’m a huge Star Wars fan.  Also one of my favorite scenes in the whole series: “The Force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.”
- Theres a fight in star wars rebels with no music at all.  It changes the fight from being epic and adrenaline filled to tense and somewhat unnerving.

I think the only time music ever made me feel worse was during silent hill because most of it barely qualifies as music in the first place.
- Oh geez... I still get the feels when I think of that scene.
- It was done first in the original Jurassic Park. T-Rex saves the group from Raptors
- They're about to see real-life dinosaurs, and her brain is fucking exploding b/c of a CD-ROM (which I think were pretty commonplace even in 1993).  I guess they wanted to go overboard on the NERD thing.
- To be fair, Spielberg also somehow convinced me that even in an indoor pool there’s a shark just out of sight. The man is a monster!
- Exactly! It's not an "action" scene, but it's just fucking tense! You're just reading line after line, not knowing what the hell is gonna happen.

Likewise, the scene with Dodgson and the T-Rex. That's an actual action scene and it does not disappoint
- this!! there were lots of action sequences in the books that could have been used in the movie like camoflauged dinosaurs and i remember a motorcycle scene with the T REX if i can remember correctly?
- Yeah, just the scene with the girl doing gymnastics to kill a dinosaur
- I've never read the book, so I can't compare the two, but I agree that the movie was not garbage.  It's true that most of the CGI doesn't compare to the first, and it contains certain parts that are "straight garbage."  I believe [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h8rH8zxA64) alone accurately depicts those two negatives.  

However, it has several positives as well, particularly the characters.  

[**Exhibit A**]( https://i.imgur.com/o5MXPFU.jpg).  

**Exhibit B:**  In *Jurassic Park*, Hammond was the idealistic billionaire who wanted to give something special to the world while also leaving a legacy.  In *The Lost World*, you have the opposite; his nephew who is the personification of a person who cares about profit over people.  Despite having different personalities, they eventually realize they share a [strong familial bond.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFg-o46q0MI)

**Exhibit C:**  Young [Toby Ziegler](https://i.imgur.com/yE3VPC9.jpg) showing he was [always annoyed by people not listening to him.](https://i.imgur.com/5y6CCGO.jpg)

**Exhibit D:**  Vince Vaughn acting as a [professional photographer/videographer](https://i.imgur.com/yrZbCr8.jpg) yet [never being able to aim a camera correctly.](https://i.imgur.com/ZdYo0rH.jpg)

**Exhibit E:**  Malcolm's girlfriend portrayed by [Julianne Moore](https://i.imgur.com/x8OFazB.jpg) who, while never mentioned, I'm pretty sure is related to [Chris Pratt's character in *Jurassic World*.](https://i.imgur.com/Az31245.jpg)

**Exhibit F:**  You find out [Muldoon](https://i.imgur.com/zNU1Xmy.jpg) survived and found the strength to [come out of the closet.](https://i.imgur.com/8yqPL9M.jpg)

and last but never least...

**Exhibit G:**  [Peter Stormare](https://i.imgur.com/4N4D1Xk.jpg)
- The gymnastics bit might be the silliest thing Spielberg has ever directed.
- I’ll always appreciate JW2 for being the only one of them to portray a herbivore in any kind of a heroic role, but yeah it’s not a great movie.
- And the idea that $43m funded the whole operation, let alone turned a profit!
- My fault, sorry.
- The only thing I remember about 3 is the "Alan" dream sequence.
- "Look how much blood...."
- "Shooooooot him!!!! Shoooooot him!!!!"
- Goodbye Benny
-  . . . *okay.*
- ^^^^^^^^ok......
- I was 14 and I sat there watching the brachiosaur scene, a tear rolling down my face and thinking, “They did it. They brought dinosaurs back to life.”
- My parents did something similar, they found out I didn't even know what it was and that day we went to Blockbuster to rent it. They told me it was a little bit scary since I was scared of my own shadow at that point. I didn't care at all, I was so enthralled by how real the dinosaurs, to this day that feeling still holds up.
- I was 6 and almost peed my pants when Nedry gets killed and my mom had to take me home because I was too scared. :(
- Granpa's here to save the day, ya'll
- That bellow is awe inspiring and nightmare inducing
- They spared no expense.
- [deleted]
- No, Wu, Doctor Who is the one that travels time in a TARDIS.
- Are you watching closely?
- Great Prestige reference!
- Wait that was deleted?

She's also the Sarah Connor in the nuclear playground nightmare.
- I think I saw too many scary movies in glimpses that messed me up at the time. Critters, child's play, Man's best friend, Gremlins, yet I couldn't watch power rangers cause it was too violent. Damage was done, mom!
- Dodgson! We got Dodgson here!
- That was with a bunch of velociraptors actually! It was them getting chased by them through the brush. VERY intense.
- And she yelled out 'hey' to get the velociraptors attention, THEN did a bunch of flips as the raptor watched in awe.
- Dude you should read the book Muldoon is even a bigger badass in the book.
- [deleted]
- [deleted]
- I was so frustrated by that movie that my favorite part was when the screenwriter got eaten. It's at about 0:50 in this clip:

https://youtu.be/cVIS31ghLNQ
- Sam Neil and Alan make the whole venture worth watching.
- *I bet you'll never look at actors the same way again.*
- You watching the movie thinking about Spielberg "He did it. The son of a bitch did it!"
- "You film directors were so concerned about whether you *could,* you never stopped to consider if you *should."*
- Indeed. That shot of them playing basketball next to a wall? They could have shot that on a actual wall but not, Wiseau wanted to shoot it on a set with a fake wall. Now that's commitment.
- I could be wrong, but I don't think the mirror scene was in the theatrical cut.
- Go Go Childhood Traumas!
- Fun fact:  Cameron Thor (the actor who played Dodgson) was arrested in 2014 for kidnapping and raping a 13 yr old girl.

I guess it's not really a fun fact.
- Nobody cares...
- So incredibly cringey.
- One of my favourite images from the novel is Muldoon twirling the keys to the weapons locker as he gets more and more concerned. And then Nedry goes and accidentally hijacks the rocket launcher when he takes off.
- I dunno how to format like y'all but the tall grass and the trailer cliff scenes make the movie for me
- > The incredible tension in the camp scene

Until the dude decides the snake is scarier than the T-Rex and runs right into its mouth.
- All great additions!
- John Williams is a legend, and his music elevates every movie he scores. *The Lost World's* soundtrack often gets short shrift, but it's still one of my favorites.
- Pete Postlethwaite, what a brilliant actor.
- Man, John Williams went ham on Lost World.

[Here's what Williams wrote](https://youtu.be/gSuf5uzcbK8?t=7m15s) for the grand climactic sting of the FINALE of Jurassic Park, and [here's what he wrote](https://youtu.be/ohkUaLdXjpg?t=3m7s) to cap off an action sequence from the EARLY SECOND ACT for the Lost World.
- Malcolm leans over to Harding, 'She always got a kick out of gymnastics.'
- It's too bad he ordered all the dinosaurs to be killed immediately after filming completed. Too risky to keep them around
- He also believed that digital cinema photography was the future, so he bought a digital camera and filmed the movie with both cameras (digital and film) side by side.

This may sound like an odd thing to do but it is of note for two reasons.

1: There is a digital copy that has never been released

And...

2: This inadvertently makes The Room to be the first modern full length feature to be filmed with a stereoscopic view point.
- The way that dude fell parallel to the "wall" and ended up facing the camera in a totally different position. That's what I call movie making my man.
- "Don't go into the long grass!" is just as quotable as "Shoot her! SHOOOOOT HEERRRRR!", imo.


Plus, as it's been said, a lot of the characters were great.

There's just a few scenes that were very "How do we top Jurassic Park?" to the point that it's too over the top. But in general the movie stands as pretty good, imo. Even 3 has its moments (but generally falls shorter of 2 than 2 did of 1).


My personal ranking is JP, JP2, JW and then I can't decide if JW2 or JP3 is worse. JW2 is a better follow-up to its previous film, but I think JP3 might still be the better movie.
- I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be a venomous coral snake, which would have killed him too.
- I like how it’s all jungly and adventurous, with those drums and wind instruments. 

Jurassic Park’s music is orchestral and majestic, with strings and other expensive instruments; it goes well with the organised nature of the theme park(even if it does go wrong!).

Lego Jurassic World helped me appreciate the music because you hear it repeated so often during the game.

==================================================
Post Title: It’s no Jurassic Park, but fellow Crichton adaptation Congo has goofy pleasures galore
Author: Sumit316
Score: 19241
Content:


--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- Remember that part in Congo, where they saw the monkeys in half with laser beams?
- It was nice to see Ernie Hudson, Tim Curry, and Bruce Campbell cash some big studio tentpole checks.
- Congo came out when I was 15, and I really enjoyed it (and still do, albeit more so for the nostalgia).

Anyhow, I told my father I enjoyed it. Our relationship was pretty strained at the point in my life, as I only saw him maybe once a month. But I guess he heard me say that it was my favorite movie of all time, because it was Congo-fest 1995 when I visited him that Christmas. Almost every single gift was Congo-related. I was gifted the entire collection of Congo collecting cards, a coffee mug, Congo: Descent into Zinj for the PC, tshirts, the Crichton book, framed movie stills and production photos...if there was a product that had Amy on it, I got it that Christmas. He also gifted me what I’d call Congo-adjacent gifts: books about hieroglyphics and lost cities, and a rubber stamp collection of hieroglyphics. 

I don’t think I love my wife or child as much as my dad thought I loved Congo in 1995.

Still, though, four out of five stars for sure.

Edit: for those concerned about my relationship with my father, my dad and I are BFFs...though I sometimes still tease him about Christmas 1995 and ask him “Why no love for Tremors themed Christmas when I was 10?”
- Ernie Hudson is so unbelievably good in this movie.

“Monroe Kelly. I’m your great white hunter on this trip though I...happen to be black”

Also the line “When the moon is like that, every monkey for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis Presley.”

Just...perfection.
- #  [STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rObnAFr4qr4)
- The movie is goofy fun, but the book is a lot better. The grey apes are treated almost like horror creatures and could be terrifying. Id be down for a more serious take on the material.
- A very fun guilty pleasure for me and my family everything about is pure entertainment. 

Stop eating my sesame cake!!!!
- It was a good film. "Ugly woman. Ugly woman."
- Did you give her the banana with the dope inside?
- The diamond powered laser gun at the end was badass haha
- That movie was awesome.


The only movie based on Crichton so far that let me down and left me disappointed was Timeline.
- Sorry are we talking about the one with the gray apes horror movie where they smashed people's brains
- It’s worth it just for Tim Curry’s goofy accent.  Ernie Hudson being basically Black Clarke Gable, and Bruce Campbell’s cameo.
- “Stop eating my sesame cake!”
- “Are you giving that gorilla a martini?!”
- For as bad as this movie is the cast is almost legendary. Ernie Hudson,Laura Linney,Tim Curry,Joey Pants,Delroy Lindo, Bruce Campbell and last but not least Joe Don Baker
- My wife and I have been together for about 15 years now and every time she needs cheering up I mimic the “Amy, sad gorilla” sign language. 

If that doesn’t work i immediately on to be yelling 
“I said stop eating my sesame cake!”

Works every time.
- **WHO'S KAFKA?! TELL ME!!**
- After spending a half hour in these comments, I realized Netflix executives are going to be puzzled why a 1995 film about an American ape in Africa is suddenly a top ten trending movie tonight.
- Liar liar pants on fire!!
- I unapologetically love Congo. 

It came out when I was 12 and there was pretty much nothing cooler to me, at the time, than going into the jungle with advanced technology to find an ancient lost city guarded by some legendary killer apes. 

Even to this day I can remember so many specific moments from that film. 

I know it’s cheesy. I don’t care.
- It's brilliantly shit and rewatchable a bit like The Core.
- I was visiting Africa with my brothers and we quoted this every time we saw it on the menu. Such a bizarre and classic scene.
- Woah, I forgot I saw this in theater.  Congo 1995, Jurassic Park 1997 and Sphere 1998.  Read all 3 of this amazing books by Critchton but Jurassic Park was only the best adaptation by far.
- I don't remember much about Congo, but I will forever remember [Cosgrove talking about Congo](https://youtu.be/TyK5E8JbaC0) and I think I prefer to keep it that way.
- I was 7 or so when it came out and thought it was awesome and still do. 

The “jungle adventure” genre doesn’t get a lot of play. But it does a nice job with a believable story (both sci fi and historical), a fantastic cast (how can you not love Monroe Kelly), and good laughs. 

Now I wanna watch.
- I paid £20 to get this movie on blu ray and never watched it until last month and honestly was the greatest purchase ever
- 100% agree. I mean, it’s ridiculous. But very few movies establish so many interesting side characters. Ernie, Delroy, Joey Pants, Bruce Campbell, Tim Curry, etc. None of these are the leads and some only have one scene, but they all left an impression.
- Spoilers* 

>!My favourite scene in the whole movie is when the evil Gorilla runs into the temple and throws a severed head at Tim Curry, and the look of ‘horror’ on Tims face is just absolutely priceless!!<
- That Tarzan didn't show up to fight the apes in the lost city seemed like a wasted opportunity to me.
- 1 the gorilla drinking a martini

2 using flares to counter the AA missiles

underrated movie
- Reading all these comments makes me happy.. So many people know the book and and the movie the way I do lol
- This is the best bad movie ever because the great cast knows it's ridiculous.
- Still waiting for the motion sensor machine guns to hit Amazon. I’d love to have one of those bad boys in my front yard.
- STOP EATIN MY SESAME CAKE!!!
- I'm waiting for Congo World
- Great soundtrack
- I can quote Congo all day. 

Glad it's getting the respect it's due. 

..STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!
- I love Tim Curry in this movie! Peak 90's flick right here!
- Put them on the endangered species list!
- “The EYE it is THE SAME!” Love Tim curry in this
- I’ll always have a soft spot for this movie because as kids my cousin and I convinced our grandmother to take us to this instead of a Disney movie, telling her it was about a talking monkey.  Then ten minutes into it Bruce Campbell has a bloody eyeball thrown at him.
- The pinball machine was pretty damn fun.
- Love this movie, it taught me how dangerous hippos can be, no one believed me in elementary school, damn hungry hungry hippos making them seem soft...
- I enjoyed this movie and those apes scared the god damn shit out of me as a kid
- For me Anaconda is even better. “I used to be a priest. Now I hunt the snake.”
- I would watch this movie again just for the cathartic gorilla slicing laser and Laura Linney.
- I miss Michael Crichton’s books :(
- Five minutes of Bruce Campbell and an insanely over the top performance from Tim Curry.
- Amy was a better actress than Jennifer Lopez.
- This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

Such an excellent mix of camp and genuine action, excellent lines, excellent actors, Ernie Hudson has NEVER been better.

"I'm your great white hunter for this trip, though I... happen to be black."

And Laura Linney's character is such a refreshing change of pace from how women were portrayed in blockbuster action films in the 90s. Competent, badass, attractive, but never sexualized or caricaturized in any way. There is a bit of sexual tension between her and the male lead, but romance or sex is never shoehorned in, and more often than not HE'S cast in the damsel role with her as the hero.

What a cool movie.
- Amy recommend
- Chemically flawless diamonds...yeah that's cool.

Can't we just make those in a lab, Bruce?
- We rented this movie from Blockbuster and that was also the first time I ever ate a mango and now I associate the movie with mangos.
- From the writer of *Moonstruck*, *Joe Versus the Volcano*, and *Doubt*...
- “Stop eating my sesame cake!” I just watched this movie recently and it is hilarious. I know it’s not meant to be a comedy but I highly recommend it if your looking for a good laugh.
- I swear, Ernie Hudson’s character should have been the main focus in this movie. He’s far more interesting than the two scientists in the movie (they’re not bad, just not as good as the main focus)
- Amy want raindrop drink!!!
- STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!
- Telecommunication Specialist doesn't mean today what it meant during that movie.
- I read this book when I was like 12 or 13. Scared the crap outta me.
- I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was a young teenager, I was home alone and I didn't get a wink of sleep that night. It was a great movie, but those white apes at the end scared the shit out of me.
- Monkey gets miracle talking gloves. Immediately asks for Pepsi and Taco Bell.
- I actually watched this movie for the first time about a year ago on Prime and I wound up thoroughly enjoying the film (some of the cheesiness aside)
- STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!!!!
- Hey, member when the gorilla throws the dudes eyeball? Lol
- They should have just subtitled Amy and it would have been 100 times better. She doesn't have the voice box in the book.
- STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE
- “Absoluuuutely true!”
- "Me Amy"

"Angry gorilla"
- This Movie will always be a memorable movie for me. I worked in a Movie Theater in my high school/college years as a lowly concession stand worker. However, management decided that the summer of 1995 I should learn projection to help cover the projectionists schedule. I learned how to feed and start the projector and check them periodically for brain wraps. Most importantly due to the type of projectors we had to manually assemble the reels and check for heat splices. The screen would jump if a heat splice went through the projector so you have to run your finger over every inch of film. Find them, cut them out and tape splice them back together. Congo was my first film I got to build and management was impressed that I did not mess it up. Side note, the reason movie theaters had Thursday night midnight showings was to make sure the film was spliced correctly. Employees friends and family were only allowed to attend. It was only recently movie theaters decided to let the public come in because they didn't think there was an audience for Thursday night at midnight. 

Thanks for taking me back down memory lane.

Favorite quote by Delroy Lindo as Captain Wanta: "Mr. Homolka, stop eating my sesame cake!"
- I loved Congo. I begged my mom to take me. We had to drive an hour to a town that had a movie theater. I bought the book and read it, despite being 11 and having trouble with Crichton's technical jargon (same issues with JP). I had the action figures that did crossovers with my JP figures.

Edit, I was 12, almost 13 when it came out. I was almost 11 when Jurassic Park was out.
- Does anyone remember the cheap digital watches that a fast food restaurant did in cross promotion for this movie? I wore mine for like a year and forgot to take it off before swimming one day and ruined it.

I mostly remember advertising hype for this movie was HUGE and I never really heard much about it after it released.  I saw it in theatres as a kid and remember being really disappointed, but I was expecting another Jurassic Park.  Should probably revisit it.
- Killing off Bruce Campbell in the first few minutes was a crime! I crime I tells you.

I went to see it because he was in it. :P
- I have this bizarre memory of being a teenager working at McDonald’s. And the other knuckleheads working there would do the sort of gorilla sign language from this film. 

“Xyz employee ugly gorilla!”     

For a period of weeks that shit was hysterical
- What a great film. Jimmy Buffet is the airplane pilot.
- I have a younger sister named Amy, she doesn't care for this movie as much as I and my brother did. Not a clue why.
- “*STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKES!!*”
- KR81452. I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid and I still have the main lady's satellite login password burned in my brain! 

Greatest movie ever, on par with the mummy for fun/scary childhood memories.
- Please stop eating my sesame cake!
- There has not been a single family gathering since this movie came out that didn't involve someone yelling "Stop EATING my SESAME CAKE!"
- My friends and i did a podcast on this movie, for those who'd like a listen 

I'm listening to Horror PSA | Episode 6 - Congo on Podbean, check it out! https://www.podbean.com/ea/pb-sm53r-c78021
- The article mentions the movie Sphere, with Dustin Hoffman. Another great guilty pleasure!
- As shitty as this movie was , the book Congo was actually really good.

The same with Sphere.   That movie sucks, but it’s one of my all time favorite books.

You hit the nail on the head when you mentioned Jurassic Park.   Movie studios were trying to capitalize of the success of Crichton adaptations after the movie Jurassic Park.  So they rushed these two piles of garage out.   It’s a shame because they’re both great books.

I think they did the same with Rising Sun.

If you want to see another good Crichton adaptation, watch The 13th Warrior.  That was a great adaptation of Crichton’s “Eaters of the Dead.”
- "Put em on the endanger species list!" Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
- “Stop eating my sesame CAKE!”
- [deleted]
- Remember that part in Congo where too much sesame cake was eaten?
- This is the part after screaming Bruce Campbell, right?
- It's the latest thing in communications.
- That's all I remember about the movie. It's probably been twenty plus years since I've seen it.
- The movie is enjoyably over the top IMO. The entire context is this the corporate type dude is developing some space laser and selling it to the highest bidder. What sort of McGuffin makes the space laser work? Big diamonds. Then you have Amy the talking gorilla. I'd put it more in a group with Anaconda, and I quite enjoy both of them.
- The only thing I remember is someone getting an eyeball thrown at them. I think it's like 10 seconds into the movie.
- Stop eating my sesame cake.
- I didn’t realize Bruce Campbell was in this..looks like I gotta rewatch it!
- Joe Pantoliano is in it for a bit too
- If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll act in anything you want.
- Sounds like dad was trying... he just didn’t know how to connect. Not sure how you ultimately feel but it is def a humorous story.
- >I don’t think I love my wife or child as much as my dad thought I loved Congo in 1995.

This made me legitimately laugh out loud.
- Tbh it sounds to me like opening those gifts goes from pretty good, to pretty lame, to absolutely epic when you realise youve basically got every single piece of memorabilia from the whole film and you now have to have an undying love for congo every time you see your dad.
- *waves and shakes hands around “Amy good gorilla”
- I love it. Your dad wasn’t sure how to connect and or plainly express love so he went HAM on Congo. Wonderful.
- This is wholesome as fuck. Hilarious, but amazing! Your dad was really trying from the sounds of it and seems like he wanted to make Christmas *epic as balls* for you that year. 

5/7 attempting-dad
- This is the funniest comment I’ve ever seen on Reddit. I’ve spent the last few minutes passing my phone around my roommates, who then read it and slowly descended into laughter. then the next roommate is curious, rinse and repeat. God bless you /u/ParkerFloyd40
- I LOVED that PC game, and had completely forgotten about it until reading your comment.
- You should tell your dad there's a Congo pinball machine
- This happened to me with hello kitty. I had a hello kitty backpack in high school at one point and then people just didn't stop giving me hello kitty gifts. I'm 36 and it's still happening.
- Regardless of all the things we don't know about your relationship with your father, at least in the moment he tried his ass off.  That counts for a lot.
- [deleted]
- That was genuinely a great and hilarious read. He gave you a memory and story that you’ll cherish as much as Congo.
- Let's be honest, Ernie Hudson is good in everything. Ernie Hudson rocks.
- Also gotta give a shout out to Delroy Lindo.

“STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!”
- I ran away!
- Air conditioning? Shit.... I’ll take one 😂
- His choice to play the role like Cary Grant in *Mogambo* was not only a great choice (him happily accepting an air conditioner is great), it's making me itch to watch *Mogambo*.
- “Here, burn it off with this....”
- Isn't that line a reference to the fact his character is a white scottish dude in the books?

I think Crichton had Sean Connery in mind when writing the character.
- He said Monroe was his favorite role of all his movies.
- Yes I gave her the banana with the dope inside.
- I met this dude one time and told him i loved all his movies and he say “why thank you very much” and his hand devoured my hand as he shook it. He’s freaking huge!
- Even the way he says "I ran away" after getting confronted by the silverback is something I always think about when I'm about to run away.
- "...they tend to just Murder everybody. And they have a lot of scores to settle."
- He’s easily the best thing in it. Hammy part, and he revels in it.
- I seem to remember reading an interview where he said it was his favorite role he ever played.
- So many good one liners from him in this one! Yes I have her the banana with the dope inside!
- The scene where dips out when the silver back charges. “I ran away.”
- My favorite character in the movie.
- I remember a behind the scenes interview where Hudson said that he was originally cast to subvert the tired old great white hunter stock character and that they expected him to "urbanize" the role in classic 90s Will Smith fashion by dropping those precious "Aw, hell nah" type of reactions. He instead fought hard to play it absolutely straight - which is of course much better and aged beautifully. It is also authentic. Those types of dudes, regardless of their color, are still in Africa to this day.
- Honestly, one of my all time favorite movie moments. The comedic timing between the captain and Tim Curry always kills me!
- My name is Herkermer Holmolka.
- Amy. Want. Green drop. Drink.
- WHO IS KAFKA??! TELL ME!!
- Heet theh road as dey say.  Ehnd have a nice deh.




Classic.  It's on again as I type this, they just drove with Cypher through the airport and met up with Winston.
- This is the only reason I opened this thread.
- Del Roy Lindo deserves an Oscar for every role
- My first thought due to my time with the hive mind. But from that scene growing up we always quoted, "Don't-want-nobody-peaking!" when he staples the bag.

Loved Congo. I still have a Kahega action figure.
- As an interesting aside, Sesame cake is delicious.
- I would watch an entire movie just about Delroy Lindo’s character in Congo.
- Random fun fact: [Delroy Lindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delroy_Lindo), AKA Captain Wanta, was actually *uncredited* for this role. He's my favorite character from the movie and one of my favorite "random side characters" of all time.
- This will forever be one of, if not my favorite, lines in any movie ever
- Should’ve been Academy Award Nominated Delroy Lindo.
- Lol came to comment this, but you have the link and erthing.
- Favorite line of any movie!
- The sesame cake incident went down in history
- [This](https://youtu.be/rObnAFr4qr4?t=12) has been my phone's alert tone for ten years.
- There it is.
- Fifty six thousand dollars
- 100% best part of the movie
- I don't think most Crichton adaptations really capture the underlying dread present in a lot of his novels. I read his books in my teens, back when they were regularly adapting his films and Congo, Sphere, even Jurassic Park felt kind of watered down.
- Was about to post this. It’s probably been close to 25 years since I read that book and I still very clearly remember being terrified. Great book.
- The movie apes were terrifying to me and I found *Congo* the movie quite harrowing, but also I was 11.
- The movie wasn't even close to capturing the feel of the book. I loved jurassic Park. I enjoyed the book better because of how much I felt like I was *in* it. So I thought Congo would bring me to the same place. 

I did not want to be there. It was so scary. The movie played it down, the movie made it like an adventure when it was a horror. I would still watch a new movie adaptation if they tried to capture the essence of the book.
- It also has more of a message.

The ancient civilization trained apes to in turn train other apes. The people were long gone, but the cycle of apes was still going. Sort of like Saberhagen’s “Beserker”, but with gorillas instead of robots.

If Jurassic Park was about the follow of trying to turn an inherently chaotic system into a clockwork machine, then Congo would be a meditation on how the things we create can keep affecting the world long after we are just a memory.
- The book is such a different experience and true proper Michael Crichton. Blending late 20th Century techno thriller with the lost world genre. Granted despite being white in the book I always imagine the hunter as Ernie Hudson cause the movie version is cooler.
- This movie did terrify me when it came out
- They WERE terrifying. 

I was about 6, Congo was showing after Casper the Friendly Ghost, we made it about 20 minutes in before the first Gorilla attack showed on screen and I flipped out and made dad take us home.
- My expectations for this movie were too high because of how much I enjoyed the book.  
Sphere was the same, but worse.
- 6 year old me took it pretty damn serious lol
- I learned how to make sesame cakes because of this movie
- Best. line. Ever.
- MY SESAME KEK!!!
- Amy want GREEN DROP Drink
- I gave her the banana with the dope inside
- Take an uncut diamond, cram it into a laser, shoot down a satellite. Makes perfect sense.
- I think a TV series adaptation would fit Timeline better.
- Bad gorilla. Amy good gorilla. 

I fucking love this movie.
- Wait there is a movie version of Timeline?
- Oh, I came to say the opposite; Crichton adaptations have a history of being books I loved and movies that were meh.
- Thank god no one tried to adapt State of Fear
- The 13th Warrior [Eaters Of The Dead] is the most under rated Michael Crichton adaption.  

But Timeline did have that sweet siege scene.
- Sphere wasn’t great
- The lost city of Zinj!
- You talking about the lasers sawing then in half?! 
*signs energetically
- In the book, the apes use stone ping pong paddles to smash heads.
- The myth of the killer gorilla is *true!*
- Scarred me for life.
- STOP. EATING. MY. SESAME. CAKE! 

That scene alone was so ridiculous it drug down the movie to a B movie with a nice budget. It is so out there with that eccentric govt official and it's practically pointless. One of my favorite scenes in any movie though.
- “She’s allowed one, it’ll calm her down.”
- Now I’ve got to learn how to sign “sad gorilla” that it’s pretty funny
- "Sir, something has happened!"
- I'm ashamed to say I like The Core lol
- I don't know what it is about The Core but whenever I find it on TV I always watch it until the end. I mean it is utterly ridiculous but it just works on some level.
- Deep Blue Sea
- The Lost World was ‘97. Jurassic Park was ‘93.
- Was probably because Spielberg directed it. Also JP came out in '93. Also Jurassic Park is the only one that Crichton actually wrote the screenplay for.
- Congo's okay, Freakazoid is awesome.
- "On your left."
- And the killer laser perimeter fence!
- That great Jerry Goldsmith score is probably the biggest gulf in quality in film history between soundtrack and movie.
- What are you doing in my country? You bag of shit. This fellow is a big. Bag. Of. Shit.
- >And Laura Linney's character is such a refreshing change of pace from how women were portrayed in blockbuster action films in the 90s. Competent, badass, attractive, but never sexualized or caricaturized in any way. There is a bit of sexual tension between her and the male lead, but romance or sex is never shoehorned in, and more often than not HE'S cast in the damsel role with her as the hero.

Agreed! She's practically Ripley-esque in her competence and overall badassery. There was an alternate scene in the hot air balloon at the end where she and the dude kiss, but that got cut, thankfully.
- *signs energetically
- My husband and I say this all the time!
- “Green drop”
- "But why did you have to shoot her!?"

"She kept going on about something called 'GME' and saying nonsense like 'diamond hands'. What else was I supposed to do!?"
- Evvvvvery word of it!
- My best friend worked at a theater in high school and watching movies before anyone else on Thursday nights is a great memory for me.
- I love how her character just goes full ham after two hours of being a rational, objective scientist.
- I'm pretty sure those white apes were already on the endangered species list. 

They needed to be taken off, one way or another...
- I always scream that line out anytime I see Laura Linney in anything. 

"I'm Laura Linney, and this is Masterp-"

"ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST!"

It always annoys my bae.
- If that wasn’t Oscar worthy, nothing is.
- “What the hell is that thing?”

“The latest thing in communication!”

5G?!
- He was my favourite character. He and Tim Curry's character needed more scenes together
- My favorite line from that movie by far.
- That's the funniest line in a non-comedy movie ever
- >STOHP EETINGK MY SESSAMI CAEK
- It took my a long time to realize that was Bruce Campbell. It took me even longer to realize the other dude with him in the beginning is Academy nominated actor John Hawkes.
- I wish I could overclock my SatPhone to do that
- [deleted]
- As I recall from one of his biographies, he turned down a lead in a different movie to be in Congo and he basically points out how terrible of an idea that was. Can’t for the life of me remember what the other movie was though.
- He plays charles Travis who is in the movie for like 2 minutes lol
- He gets all of like the very very beginning of the film
- He has like a grand total of like 5 minutes of actual screen time.

Edit: Guess I should read ALL the replies first before telling you something everyone else has said 100 times lol my bad.
- Wow, a talking gorilla! I can feel the money hairs on the back of my neck going "WOO-WOO-WOO".
- [John Hawkes](https://actionagogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hey-its-John-Hawkes.png) is also in it, and he's a solid actor in things like The Perfect Storm and Deadwood. I fucking love Deadwood, and looking him up just to be sure I see that they made a TV movie in 2019 I'll have to watch. The cover pic says "Welcome the fuck back - Deadwood the movie" lol.
- And a young Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje
- Seriously, it sounds like some of that stuff would take effort to track down. I don't even know how you'd find some of it in pre-ebay 1995. I'd ask my parents for stuff straight out of the catalogue and it was still a crapshoot.
- Sounds like Dad didn't have a lot of time to with his son to figure out what his interests were, and when he finally did find one he put all that effort into the one thing he heard his son say he liked.
- I edited my comment to include this info, but we laugh about it now. We became quite close somewhere around my 25th birthday, and are  now quite close and love one another very much.
- Same here!
- "Amy good father"
 "Amy only try best"
- That’s a line my friends and I use when we do something stupid or questionable, haha “<name>, good gorilla”
- Same here, except I had the Sega Saturn port. I couldn't get past the first level haha
- [deleted]
- Love Ernie Hudson, he’s great in every role of his I’ve seen
- Uh, if there's a steady paycheck in it, he’ll act well in anything you want.
- "That's a big twinkie."
- I felt bad for the guy when Ghostbusters 2016 was coming out. He desperately wanted a franchise reboot as he'd likely get some parts in it, but you could just hear the defeat in his voice when trying to sell it as he knew it wasn't gonna live up to peoples hopes.
- He's great in The Crow; I would have wished to see more of that character
- Ernie Hudson was in Dragonball Evolution...
- Now i want cake
- ...sorry!
- In an alternate, maybe better reality, Congo would have been a gigantic hit and we'd have watched our fourth Monroe spinoff movie by now.
- [deleted]
- This fellow is a big. Bag. Of. Shit.
- A bag of shit.
- The name "Homolka" sent a shiver down the spines of a lot of Canadians in the mid 90s. I know hearing that name in the movie did for me.
Edit : For those that weren't around in the 90s or were from outside of Canada, look up "Karla Homolka"
- I have tics, where there's certain names or words that I get stuck in my head, and I have to repeat them when I get stressed. Other things include counting my steps, touching the edges or tips of things when I walk past (like Monk but not as obsessive, I don't mind missing an object), and focusing on my breathing to be in rhythm with my pace when I'm walking.

Herkermer Holmolka is one of those names that give me pause when I say it. It's like a straight hit of calm on my soul.

I feel kinda weird saying that now
- *waves hands around erratically
- Amy. Good. Gorilla.
- “Ugly. Gorillas. Ugly. Fuck them bitches.”

Amy, wait... what?
- You surprise him 😃
- A talking gerrilla. I can feel the money hairs on the back of my neck going woo woo woo.
- Hit him with a can of peanut oil
- The man fucking delivers.
- He only had a small part in The Last Castle, but he sure does sell any role he plays.
- Damn dude you a real fan! Kahega had like 2 scenes in the whole movie and they made an action figure of him with huge guns lol
- You ever seen “the 13th Warrior” with Antonio Banderas? Epic to be sure
- Sphere was enjoyable. Not as good as the book, which is common with the adaptations, but pretty close. And a good cast to pull it off. Thirteenth Warrior did a pretty good job capturing Crichton’s atmosphere.
- Ridley Scott said his Jurassic park was going to be a lot, lot darker.
- If Spielberg makes Micro like I read a couple of years ago, I will be in the front row. I loved that book.
- Same with Sphere. When the creature was attacking the station I was so scared. I loved Crichton when I was in HS. Never read JP though.
- I read the book in 5th grade and still have problems separating the gray back gorillas from normal gorillas. Awesome book.
- Same, that movie terrified me as a kid
- Did you allow people to touch them?
- Ugly gorilla go a way
- That's what made it so great to me. Really solid cast, interesting plotline, bright visuals, and then space lasers powered by giant diamonds along with a talking ape and band of murderous gray backs protecting the diamonds like they were a dragon and a pile of gold. You start taking it serious, and all the sudden stop eating my sesame cake has you chuckling.
- As a kid, this movie made me love computers. It especially made me want a laptop. [Lol my parents got me something like this. Mine basically only had a calculator and a scheduler. I loved that thing](https://www.google.com/search?q=electronic+organizer+90s&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiS6sTBv6zwAhUHOawKHbbsBUQQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=electronic+orga&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BQgAELEDOgcIABCxAxBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDUP6qBliWzwZgt-AGaABwAHgAgAHkAYgB1QuSAQYxNS4wLjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=CWSPYNLBG4fysAW22ZegBA&bih=732&biw=1536). I would re-enact the movie with this device.

Congo and that hitman movie with Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas. Takes me back!
- Amy want green drop drink
- Ugly woman. Any pretty.
- Yeah, but… you’re better off skipping it.
- Dude, I know people are ragging on it (quite fairly), but the climax is a sweet nighttime siege attack scene with fire arrows and flaming trebuchet projectiles that honestly look SO cool, better than the quality of the projectiles in the Lord of the Rings movies from the same time. Obviously it's a way smaller scale/easier battle, and nothing else about it is better than LotR, but all the fire arrows arcing through the night sky look very neat. And then they alternate in with a volley of unlit arrows that no one can see because it's night. Cool.

A snippet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcUVOlbNb30
- Yeah. With quite the cast: [Timeline on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300556/)
- Back in 2000. It was not a hit.
- It's a good book. 

The problem is the science is just plain wrong.
- There was so much goddamn audience hand-holding to explain the plot that none of the twists are all that shocking.

…and Hoffman, Stone and Jackson are all incredible actors. Barry Levinson is a good director. Why did it feel like they were all "phoning it in"?
- Aww... I loved sphere but you’re right.
- Book or the movie. I watched the movie a week or so ago the cast was excellent. Wasn't one of the greatest movies but wasn't horrible.
- No it’s “The lost Zity of Zinj.”
- I love it, the death scenes are hilarious.
- I have watched The Core multiple times, on purpose. I love disaster movies, so once I’ve rewatched Armageddon and Deep Impact, The Core is often next on my list.
- I absolutely love this movie
- You're not wrong, for some reason it's always rewatchable, bizarre. It's just very entertaining.
- He also wrote and directed Westworld, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it. You can see the foundations of what would later become JP.
- Everything about Jurassic Park was great.  It was phenomenal seeing dinosaurs roaming the earth on the big screen for the first time with the new introduce digital sound and state of the art  CGI.  Original idea, great soundtrack, superbly directed by Spielberg, memorable quotes, great use of CGI blending with animatronics and overall great acting.  I'm so glad to experience these type of movies in theaters back in the 80s and 90s.
- “Don’t say it... Do not say it!”
- I still call olives green drops after all these years because of this movie.
- The book is the exact same way. She’s totally cool, calm, and rational and then a switch flips and she’s totally insane the next page.
- When you watch several people get their bodies crushed to pancakes by a pack of maniac gorillas and you're about to be next I'd say most people would do the same.
- Tim Curry needs more scenes in everything.
- This man is a piece of shit

/whips him with little hand whip
- It's the only thing I remember about the movie.
- [deleted]
- [deleted]

- [deleted]
- Titanic
- a great two minutes however
- Oh no, you get to see Corpse Bruce just before they start shooting lasers and evil gorillas.
- I love John Hawkes. He needs to be in more stuff. He was good in Lost even though he wasn’t in it long, and he was great in Eastbound & Down. He’s just great, but I haven’t watched Congo in maybe 5 years or so, so I can’t place him in it.

Edit: Speaking of Lost, Mr. Eko is in Congo as well. Might be more updates as I take a deep dive in this Wikipedia wormhole
- He was in an episode of the X-Files and had some of the best lines ever said in that show.
- This is pre-Amazon. Pops busted his ass to run down all that stuff for the kid. It’s a really sweet and kinda sad story. I hope their relationship survived healthy.

Edit: autocorrected to Arizona. I fixed it to Amazon.
- Toys r us would have had almost all of that stuff.   

The mall would have the rest.

The photos and framed stuff could have easily been found at a music or movie store. 

There was a lot of junk like that available pre internet.
- #Tickle daddy
- Awesome. Awesome to the max.
- Same here. I just used it yesterday!
- This makes my really happy for some reason
- Ernie Hudson lost the role of Winston in The Real Ghostbusters cartoon to Arsenio Hall ~~Rush Limbaugh~~, because they said he didn't sound enough like Winston.

Edit: the fuck was I typing?
- Really??? 

That’s awesome.
- I met Ernie Hudson at comic con a while back. He was super chill. Signed my copy of Ghostbusters and just generally seemed really grateful for his lot in life
- There is no Dragonball Evolution in Ba Sing Se.
- If they did that I'd say they're smart. They're too damn smart.
- 100% agree.... Side characters are just fantastic
- Does a lot of good...mostly for himself
- Seriously creepy lol
- She represents a very strong argument *against* plea deals.
- Yep. Every Canadian knows that monsters name. Angers me that she's free
- Yup. Years later the same actor became my favorite character on LOST: Mr Eko. I dug up my action figure and considered modding it to make it Eko.
- That film was one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. It's my favorite Crichton adaptation.
- Is that Crichton too? Damn, dude wrote a lot of movies that I enjoy as is...and am sure I would love the books. Right now I'm running through the Dune trilogy, and I honestly don't know if I could even understand it without having already seen the movie.
- Dustin Hoffman, LIev Shriber, Samuel L. Jackson and Peter Coyote. It had one hell of a cast.
- I absolutely despised the movie and i LOVED the book. The movie had some of the worst editing/directing/sound design I've ever seen, the whole thing is just boring. And it's fragmented and weird by having chapter titles, segmented into parts. Absolute garbage movie
- As much as this sub gushes over JP, I would have loved to have seen a more adult-marketed version of the film. Even like an extended cut or something. I don't just mean all the book's gore put in because I could take or leave that, but the way the film underdeveloped the idiocy of characters like Wu, sanitised Hammond and underused Malcolm really annoys me. Goldblum is incredible and I would have loved to see him get to do some of the Malcolm anti-scientism rants in full instead of just making the odd quip.
- Is Micro the honey I shrunk the kids but set in hawaii and with scientists instead?
- I haven't read Micro, but I'd love to see Prey on the big screen.
- Jurassic Park was dark as fuck. That scene that happens in the Lost World where the bloke gets eaten by compies? That's how Hammond goes out. Also Muldoon hunts raptors with an rpg, steaming drunk.
- All the books were wayyyyy better than the movies and the movie were by no means terrible.... Jurassic park the book is just unbelievably good..... But I've read every book at least 10 times lol
- Sphere is my favorite book. It's amazing
- They're the ones with gray backs.
- I haven't seen it in years, but I third this. Might be the age when I saw it but those things were terrifying, and definitely made me wary of large apes in general.
- I didn't even let my mom have one
- Amy beautiful.
- Stop eating my sesame cake.
- thanks for the warning! Imma take your advice and just re-read the book in the near future. It was pretty neat and I'm feeling like I need to go back in time :)
- i dont understand the hate this movie gets, i love it
- Have you seen The Messenger, Luc Besson's Joan of Arc flick with Milla Jovovich? That movie had some wild siege battles as well, it's pretty fun.
- I loved that scene, and enjoyed the movie a bit. The one thing that always makes me laugh my ass of is the 'Night arrows!!' part... like dog i get they are hard to see, but they are just regular arrows at night lol
- The fact that he made the science so prominent, studded the novel with graphs and reports and footnotes, and even added an author's note underlining all the bad science he was trying to promote, makes it a very bad book to me.

The cannibal shit is also stupid.
- To be fair, if you ever read the book, it's got to be a nightmare to write a screenplay for, much less a being the director and interpreting how to fit it visually.
- I could've sworn it was "tha Lozt Zity af Zinsh."
- Or when their super rare drill machine breaks but luckily someone else also happens to have a super rare drill machine. Chef's kiss.
- Seeeeerge!
- "You want me to hack the planet?" movie?
- .....



....

^^^^on ^^^^your ^^^^left
- I'd like to read it again. I don't rememeber it being as pulpy and silly as the movie, but it sounds like it actually was.
- IIRC, she’s also basically the books antagonist. Pushing everyone to go further into murder monkey territory and getting people killed.
- I watched the movie once at an overnight with friends and fell asleep not long after they landed and started exploring the Congo. I woke up when the lasers start cutting gorillas in half. Needless to say I was very confused.
- And isn't it explained away by her reading her own HR file which has a psych analysis or saying she's prone to risk taking towards the end of a project or something ?
- The book had a better rational for it though. The book apes were some scary fuckers. Not like the muppets in the movie
- Crichton even justifies it with some (pseudo?)scientific theory about how people's personalities invert while under extreme pressure.
- It's more about her demeanor and the silly line. She sure doesn't seem scared to me.
- I mean, he has to basically be doing his best Steve Guttenberg impression, right? I refuse to believe anything else.
- He's also in True Lies.
- And Laura Linney of course, three-time Oscar nominee.
- Fricken Mandela effect got you. I hate that.
- This is in part why I love it. It's was planned to be the next Jurassic Park and failed on just about every aspect, making this an even more interesting film.
- TIL Michael Crichton did ER.
- Jeez when you put it like that... How did Congo turn out so bad?
- Yup... In the same year he had the best selling book, most watched TV series, and most grossing movie.

The Lost World, ER, and Jurassic Park.
- Woulda been a shoe in for billy zane’s character
- I don't know how anyone acquired physical goods before the state of Arizona.
- I've just asked him and he told me it wasn't that hard to get a hold of most of this stuff without the internet. There were mostly stores in the mall and a Toys r Us he was able to get everything from. I still give him a 10/10 for effort.
- This is.... not true he lost out to Arsenio Hall. Weird substitution there.
- Holy shit I cannot stop laughing how did you accidentally type Rush Limbaugh
- Lo’ there do I see my father...
- It has probably been 20 years since I've seen that movie, but I'm hesitant to rewatch it in the even that it doesn't live up to my memory. Middle school me thought it was awesome.
- I love that movie too! There are dozens of us, dozens!
- Past few weeks I’ve been listening to a comedian’s podcast on Dune. Kinda entertaining if you want to hear their take on it. I love me some spice girls. 

https://open.spotify.com/show/0A3IirSc3Qi2MSFJcz2unj?si=hyTQnEyJSMyQzZy7Qq2LGw
- Sharon Stone and Queen Latifah as well.
- HBO is doing an adaptation of Sphere as a show with the same team that did Westworld (which was also a Crichton adaptation). I'm hopeful that will be better as I also did not enjoy the movie version.
- I need to reread JP. I enjoyed the video game for it on my Sega because it added in parts of the book to the game play that were missing from the movie. There was so much more content missing.
- I love how in Lost World the real life science had progressed and it was discovered T Rex could see things standing still just fine so he wrote it into the story. Guy telling someone else to stand perfectly still in front of the t rex right before it eats him.
- It’s vicious...I’ve read it a couple of times and the deaths were hardcore. A guys gets ripped art by ants, another guy gets immobilized by a wasp while it lays an egg inside hide him, it goes on, and I loved it. LOL
- There was a part in Prey where I couldn't suspend disbelief. It was something about the characters all doing some kind of dance routine, where they all moved in synchronisation, so as to confuse the nanobots. It made no sense to me, and I basically had to pretend I didn't read that chapter, during the remainder of the book.

Well I would hope they'd leave that part out, it would look even more ridiculous on the big screen.
- Lost world left out the part where the compies were venomous and their venom gives you a euphoric high while also paralyzing you.  Hammond was enjoying being eaten alive.
- And the genetic engineer gets disemboweled. Need to read that again.
- The movie was still awesome, but compared to the book it's campy. That's just what happens when you try to turn a horror/suspense into a summer blockbuster though..."gotta keep it light for the kiddies".
- It's been years (decades) since I read *Jurassic Park*, but I remember they milked the book for material for the first two sequels. The “hiding from the T Rex under a waterfall” scene in *Lost World* and both the river and pteranodons aviary scenes in *III* were straight out of *Jurassic Park*.

On a related note, *Jurassic World* became the second film I've ever walked out on. The bit where the raptors just start conversing with the big bad dino was too much for my suspension of disbelief.
- Fuck. That sounds EPIC!
- The darkness and danger ratchet the tension up so high, I would love to have data on how fast i read that book. Probably took me a month to finish the first hundred pages, a week to finish the next 50-100, then like a day to finish the rest of the book. I absolutely could not put it down after it hit its stride. Congo was somehow even more intense, which is strange, because the dinosaurs seemed so much more perilous. I guess Congo felt a little more real maybe.
- Also Malcolm technically dies doesn't he?
- Timeline was almost a completely different story.  I LOVE that book but the movie was just not good lol
- I’m black I should be carrying luggage on my head
- Eh, Timeline was fine. If you think you'll have a problem with it, just go in expecting to watch a decent time travel action movie. It's perfectly good on its own.
- If you’ve read the book the movie isn’t even the same genre and many little things that have the book make sense are just gone or changed. They took the “history” out of it and added a grenade scene which doesn’t make sense. Also Paul Walker can’t act for shit no offense. He’s one of the worst actors I’ve seen.
- I read State of Fear recently and, while I had heard of it, I generally didn’t know anything about it beyond it being a pretty well known Crichton book. I was not prepared.

It left me with a lot of mixed feelings, because the general plot was good, the bad science was really distracting.  And the way he approached the arguments was just way too reminiscent of all the COVID denier shit we’ve been hearing for the past year.  

I wish I hadn’t read it.  I still like Crichton’s other books, but State of Fear negatively affected my view of him a bit
- That's the one.
- That’s the one.
- I don’t know if any author can write as pulpy and silly as Tim Curry can perform the material.  That man was fully in his element here.
- A lot of people read Crichton when they were young and forget how pulpy almost all of his writing is.
- They get eaten by hippos in the book
- All of Crichton's books are like this. Basically  summer blockbusters of the mind. This is one of my favorites.
- It’s totally pulpy. All of his books are. I love them, but they ain’t exactly Moby Dick.
- It’s not. Omg. This is a classic example
of the Hollywood adaptation. I don’t remember 100%, but In the book they use the lasers to “communicate” and in the movie they use them as weapons. It’s wild. 
It’s up there with Dreamcatcher, where the climax of the book is inside the kids head, and the movie has Morgan freeman in a helicopter with heavy artillery.
- It isn't. Congo, Jurassic Park, Sphere, they're all horror with other genres mixed in. Event Horizon minus the gore is way closer in tone to the book than the real movie adaption.
- It's just an interpretation done by story tellers to try and squeeze all the energy they can out of a scene. The nice thing about books is you play a part in what these things look like based on how you interpret the words in your head. So an event in a book might have played out way more serious through your interpretation while the director/editor portrayed it another way.

A good example, IMO, is that scene in Jurassic Park when Nedry is trying to make the docks with those embryos, crashes his Jeep^^TM, and is confronted by a Dilophosaurus. I read the book before the movie, and in the book I remember that scene being dark, tense, and a bit scary...as a kid at the time. In the movie it's okay, but it comes off kind of like slap stick. The main difference is when I read it Nedry didn't sound like he belonged on Seinfeld, and in the movie he was like weaselly comic relief.
- Yeah, it says she’ll get super aggressive and bad tunnel vision towards completing a goal, cost be damned.
- [deleted]
- He's the coffee coffee coffee guy in Dante's Peak too!
- And Scorpion King's sidekick.
- That’s what they get for trying to build a six lane dinosaur roadway through the jungle.
- [deleted]
- He also had an M.D.
- What are the themes of Congo? And which characters are their avatars?

You can answer that pretty easily in Jurassic Park. Pretty much everyone is a symbol for something. And a lot of them are symbols of themes or ideas that are in contrast with one another. The experiences of the film allow us to witness a sort of dialogue take place.

Congo isn't quite so clear about it. You can still get the sort of "impact on the world from human greed through the lens of modern technology" story but it isn't quite so clear.

Also there's the fact that the gorillas just aren't as believable as the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. In part because technology hadn't advanced to the point where it worked as well with fur as it did with pebbled skin, and in part because we had real gorillas to compare against. Nobody could say that the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park didn't look how they should.

Even then it hardly bombed. $150M box office against $60M budget. It wasn't Jurassic Park but it made the studio its money back.
- I was thinking Rose. 

If you can’t see Bruce Campbell as the obvious love interest, I don’t know what to tell you.
- That is peak BZ though hard to imagine someone else
- Tis a mystery
- You'd have to look in the phone book for a business that might have what you wanted, then call them and ask. For normal products you'd see them in the weekly newspaper leaflets for Wal-Mart, Kmart, Sears, or whatever.
- Lol whoops....I absolutely meant arsenio. NO IDEA why I typed rush limbaugh
- Lol I have no fucking idea!
- Lo, There do I see my Mother and My Brothers and my Sisters...
- Not so much "missing" as stuff that had to be omitted for pacing/runtime and possible tech limits, which JP itself was already pushing hard. Plus there's a few things from the original novel that ended up resurfacing in other flicks (like the final Spinosaurus attack in JP3 very much resembling the swimming T-rex of the JP novel).
- The SNES game had the Raptor nest and nerve gas you had to drop off. First game I ever wanted to map out every building.
- There were entire chapters of Ian Malcolm 'lecturing' on chaos theory, complete with illustrations of god knows what. As a kid, I remember pretending to understand all of that.
- I don't think it was anything to do with science progressing; in the book, it's a side-effect of the cannibalised DNA, whereas they just simplified it in the film to state that T-Rex could only see movement. 

While we're on the subject of real-life science, I have this weird Mandela effect moment about that. I always thought it was explicitly mentioned in the film that the dinosaurs were deliberately inaccurate so they would meet people's false expectations, but I didn't notice it being mentioned in either the book or film when I read/watched it recently. Is this a thing that is explicitly mentioned in either, or did I just make it up?
- Right but then why doesn't the T-Rex eat Grant in the first book?
- Wu?
- Read JP in 3rd grade because I thought I was too good for that junior novelization.

Boy did my mother do a double take when I mentioned the part about Wu desperately pushing a raptors head out of his disembodied stomach.

Side note: she ended up buying me the Congo-Sphere-Eaters of the Dead omnibus for Christmas the next year.
- Are you sure? I remember that happening to Nedry, not Wu.
- Honestly I consider both amazing in their own right. While the movie is a bit simpler, it does a great job of giving you dinosaur thrills with a solid plot where as a kid everything feels magical until things go horribly wrong, but as an adult the beginning is a slow burn of seeing things go wrong, hints that this park was made on the cheap, but Hammond is so idealistic he is just blind to it all, enough he puts his grandchildren in danger.
- It is.
- I grew up on the movie. Read the book and its sequel 10 years ago (and recently read them again). I think it's the one instance where I like the movie better than the book, and I really enjoyed the book. The movie is an easy top 3 for me but may be tied with nostalgia and growing up on it. 
  
That said, it's a true shame The Lost World wasn't given a truer adaptation to the book. The first book and movie are different, but similar enough. The sequels pretty much just kept the names of the characters and the trailer scene. Such a shame.
- I'm going to need some hot pockets (or whatever he says, I should watch that again).
- STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!
- It's shocking we never got a Tim Curry- Raul Julia movie. I feel like those two would have imploded or something.
- "Push me please (mmph..) harder please"
- The books he wrote that fell into his areas of interest are all pretty good.  Some of the science is bullshit but you can tell from his command of the subject that he made intentional choices to drive a story.

Later on we get... a boomer take on climate change?  Inventing a trillion-dollar technology for personal revenge, like they're the Green Goblin?
- Yep read basically every book he had written in my early teens and thought they were the best thing in literature, still fun now but the flaws are apparent.
- Yeah, but there's a difference between what I rememeber of his writing and Congo's ridiculousness. I mean, none of the other Crichton movies are this nuts, at least not that I remember.
- This is kinda the important part. She's calm and rational because she's an ex CIA agent. She loses her shit because she's about to die and just discovered her fiance is dead and knows ultimately his dad only sent her to recover an important diamond.
- She's also super pissed and about to turn her husbands fathers space laser on itself and destroy the bitch. This is after Dad is like "fuck my dead son...did you find the giant diamonds?"
- If she was CIA, I'm sure she is familiar with killer guerillas. /s
- We got...cows.
- And 13th Warrior, I think
- Bruce is obviously the iceberg, sorry
- Lo, there do I see the line of my people...BACK TO THE BEGINNING...
- > I always thought it was explicitly mentioned in the film that the dinosaurs were deliberately inaccurate so they would meet people's false expectations, but I didn't notice it being mentioned in either the book or film when I read/watched it recently. Is this a thing that is explicitly mentioned in either, or did I just make it up?

It was in the book, but as far as the movies go, it was only brought up in Jurassic World, when Wu is talking about how the dinosaurs were engineered to look "cool" rather than what they should actually look like.
- The way I understood it after the 1st movie a biologist went out of his way to prove that a T Rex had excellent vision based on the skull and the position of the eyes. So while writing the second novel Crichton specifically added a whole scene to show this new fact.
- That makes sense as they were literally building a theme park. You don't usually build them to be scientifically accurate, but to give people what they want so they'll pay to see/experience it. I don't like the vast majority of zoos, but it's like if you go to one and the lions are just lazing about....like lions do way more often than anything you'll have seen on The Discovery Channel. That's why feeding time is always a draw, because then the animals actually do shit.
- Ah, yep. Was having a brain fart, could not for the life of me remember his name.
- I think the film is the perfect adaptation for the big screen. Crichton's work sometimes can be cold and impersonal, whereas Spielberg is known for his sentimentality and spectacle. Spielberg was able to give the JP movie a heart that the novel lacked. And, of course, a John Williams score.
- There's a sequel to Timeline?
- I’ll need an unlimited supply of hot pockets and Xena tapes. They help me concentrate.

It’s nonsense, but entertaining nonsense. I love it.
- Delroy Lindo is the best part of that movie.
- Don't want anybody peeking..
- "This is pure Kafka..."

"WHO IS KAFKA?! TELL ME!!!"
- Best line in cinema!
- Those two onscreen at the same time would definitely have made my head cave in.
- Oddly enough, they both played Gomez Addams.
- Closest we came was Tim Curry playing Raul Julia playing Gomez in Addam's Family Reunion
- [deleted]
- Yeah, there was definitely a shift over time. At least early on when he didn't know a subject matter he'd do some research and get most of it right, barring what he changed for dramatic purposes or just as fantasy. It didn't take long though for it to just become fairly inverted though, with the scene-painting and action dictating the 'facts'.

Ignoring all of that though, I pretty much just meant pulpy as a descriptor. His stuff all very much has a pulp fiction style to it and when I was a kid it was a lot easier to ignore!
- Still better than Tom Clancy. Combination of slapping his name on any thing and calling it "co-authored." And the stuff he wrote himself wasn't any better, it was probably worse. And my family just kept buying them for me because I once said I liked Red October and a couple others.

They both went full boomer though.
- Best we not talk about Rising Sun then.
- Prey was good though. I’d love an HBO miniseries based on that one.
- Sphere is an amazing book but an awful movie
- I haven’t read his books in a while, but I remember the movies kind of toning down his material. Don’t get me wrong tho, I loved his books.
- > discovered her fiance is dead

Yes, and the fiancees father showed no remorse to finding his son was dead:

Her: Your son is dead.

Him: Blah..blah..blah..blah.....Did you find the giant diamonds?
- Fiance death = "alright fuck everything else but revenge" for pretty much everyone.
- If gorillas killed Bruce Campbell for real, I’d want revenge on gorillas too.
- Definitely although it does deviate quite a bit from the source material, as most of his movies do. I think its safe to say though that  if you like a movie based on his books, you'll undoubtedly enjoy those books a lot more.
- And Sphere.
- *dear diary,
Today I had to tell someone on the internet they are wrong. And I didn’t feel bad about it.*
- His chin would be the iceberg.
- I think this was a half-cocked sciencey explanation as to why the velociraptors were like 6 feet tall rather than the size of a big chicken.
- Pretty sure Crichton just brings him back in the next book as well. “I got better...”
- Don’t want nobody peaking!! *staple staple *
- I use to quote that part all the time when I was a kid. "What are you doing in my country, heh? This man is a big. Bag. Of. Shit."
- WHO IS KAFKA??? TELL ME!!!
- Him and Ernie
- I loved the book and hated the movie but the scenes with him in it are the only ones I really liked and can remember, it was that funny.
- Who’s Kafka!?
- or at least your nasal cavities just from the contact cocaine high.
- [Petty AF](https://www.wired.com/2006/12/michael-crichto/)
- Then proceeded to strawman the fuck out of global warming, pretending it can be a global conspiracy. Loved his books at 13, but the dude lost it.
- Yep pretty much.
- I imagine that's just a side effect of becoming older, wealthy, and established. Early on he had to put in the effort to make a name for himself, and now his books will sell based on that name he made. Established writers have a large block of fans that will simply buy anything they print.
- Google searches made research so much better. You can become and expert on something in just a few clicks. /s
- Remember when he spent a whole book just going back and forth between Iran being pure evil and the progressive income tax being a punishment in those who work hard?

He emphasizes constantly that Ryan isn't a far-right Republican. He's just a non-partisan Who Street billionaire who fights taxation and any spending that isn't on the military and opposes abortion and gay marriage.

Rainbow Six's plot revolved around the threat of militant vegan environmentalists.

Red October was great, though.
- Neil Stephenson is in the middle of doing this right now, and it's heartbreaking.
- That's the nano swarm one right? That would be pretty cool to see visually if done right.
- Never saw the movie, but I binge-read the book in a day in 8th grade and it scared the absolute fuck outta me.
- I’d love to see someone take another crack at adapting Sphere one day
- the book was phenomenal but GODDAMN did they ever screw up the movie. Star cast, fantastic book to base it on, and you got the worst editing/directing of a movie to ruin it. Splitting up the movie into segments with title cards was the stupidest thing they could have done, and is a great example of bad decision making.
- I had forgotten what movie that was and had to look it up. Yeah, it had a lot of potential but was just pretty flat the entire time. I like the idea of some weird alien thing at the bottom of the ocean, and how they treat it like space a bit. The worst part about that movie is, IMO, Dustin Hoffman. I love him in other movies, but he's just a wet blanket to me in it. That movie had quite the promising cast as well:

* Dustin Hoffman

* Sharon Stone

* Samuel L. Jackson

* Liev Schreiber

* Queen Latifah

* Peter Coyote

That's half the entire cast, and while these people are great in a number of movies; not so much this one. Barry Levinson doesn't strike me as a horror/suspense director, but he did do Good Morning Vietnam...and that's one of the best movies ever made IMO.
- HELLO MY NAME IS JERRY
- The ending of Sphere killed me. Great book.
- The dude was literally screaming "Did you find the diamond?" at her when she tried to tell him his son was dead.
- Yeah, if my wife died traumatically I'd be going full scorched earth. Space lasers or not, those gorillas are going down.
- I thought that was the fakiest party of the movie. No one or no thing can kill Bruce Campbell.
- Pretty sure you’re thinking of Dr. Malcolm.
- Peeking*

Peaking is what you do on molly or acid.
- Dr. Peter Elliot : What are they laughing at?



Monroe : I just told them I am in charge.



Dr. Peter Elliot : What's so funny about that?



Monroe : I'm black. I should be carrying luggage on my head.

/fucking Ernie Hudson owned that role
- Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's first movie role, too
- His stuff from the 80's was quite good. 

Everything after... not so much. Especially when Ryan becomes the frigging president lol
- I had to put the sequel to Reamde down.  And it made me really sad.
- I read it in a day too! I was probably in 10th grade, and spent the fsy  ith my dad as he taught classes. I really wd it in the car on the way there, under his desk, on the way home and in bad til it was done. Maybe the first time I read a novel that fast!
- HBO miniseries?
- Yeah, and the whole time she's trying to come to terms that her husband, the man she's literally there to try and find, is deceased. I'm sure she was hoping for a sympathetic ear as they both should have shared a similar emotion, but noooo....

#WHERE'S THE FUCKING DIAMOND!!!

==================================================
Post Title: South Florida's Hard Rock Stadium Temporarily Being Turned Into Drive-In Movie Theater With 230-Car Capacity - Upcoming screenings include “Jurassic Park”, “Knives Out”, and “Hobbs & Shaw”.
Author: BunyipPouch
Score: 18706

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- Drive ins sound great, but you can never get around the need to use communal bathrooms.
- Jurassic Park is a pretty fantastic Drive-in movie. Especially if you take an explorer.
- If the public is going to fund these stadiums, there should be more opportunities like this to use them.

Edit to add that this stadium was actually privately funded. The privately funded NFL stadiums include:

* Gillette Stadium (Patriots)
* MetLife Stadium (Jets/Giants)
* SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers)
* Hard Rock Stadium (Dolphins)
- [deleted]
- Knives Out was pretty good.
- They’re all available on streaming, but it’s still a pretty neat idea. If I’m down during any of the screenings I may do it.
- Who picked hobbs and shaw
- This world sure is weird
- The irony is Floridians aren’t even wearing masks... this is going to be a complete failure, they should have done this 2 months ago. Normal Movie theaters are opening in SFL and Florida Man can’t wait... it’s embarrassing to live here, we literally stick out like a sore thumb, or a dick I can’t decide.

Edit: I’m in Broward County 45 min north of Miami. Drive by Las Olas, or Beach Place people are crammed into restaurants, standing in outside areas on top of each other with a beer and no mask. Goto West Palm Beach, it’s not mandatory, go further north and it’s like there isn’t even a virus. I was at a Publix in Melbourne (2 hrs north)the other day  literally only cashiers and me were wearing a mask.... Old white people 60+ riddled the store with no masks...
- Damn right after I moved back up north. Always wanted to go to a drive in
- My thing is I feel like I would get hot because I can’t keep my car running, and you really wouldn’t want to have your windows down with people coughing, sneezing etc. and yeah, the toilet thing. You’d have to bring a portable potty of some kind in your own car. This won’t work well.
- Hobbs & Shaw the odd-one-out there, the other two are excellent movies. What was the thing about bald men fighting each other?
- This looks horrible. Imaging getting in and out of this shitfest. 

Just stay at home and stream the god damn movies.
- Are there going to be more drive in movies if we can’t make these days??
- Reading movie titles:

"Oooo. Ooooo. Oh. Ok. Third one was apparently a filler."
- I hope they play soul plane that’s my favorite movie
- Ok but imagine having an rc car on there
- They have to show Ace Ventura
- >“Jurassic Park”, “Knives Out”, and “Hobbs & Shaw”

One of these things is not like the other.
- So Florida! Lol
- That's pretty neat. I know it's not the same place, but I won't easily forgive Hard Rock for what they did. Their new guitar hotel has [ruined all my South facing astrophotography opportunities](http://imgur.com/gallery/AysK6sP) and I just am very frustrated with that spotlight. First image is a restaurant near the hotel, second is my house around 10 miles away.
- I can’t imagine trying to leave at the end of the movie.  Must take an hour to drive out
- No way that’s a better movie experience than a big screen at home. Is this protest movie going?
- Hobbs & Shaw sucks! I’d rather be stuck at home.
- Inb4 they all leave their cars running to keep the AC on and the whole place fills with carbon monoxide and like 500 people die.
- 250 cars to watch a fucking movie. Because fuck the environment.
- All movies I’d rather watch at home.
- Jurassic park/cop and a half double feature was my first drive in movie ever.
- I am down for this.
- Amazing adaption. Good for them!!
- Mattpat's prediction just got real, that's crazy
- I just saw Jurassic Park at the drive-in and it was one of the best theater experiences I’ve ever had. Absolutely phenomenal.
- Wow did Billy Gil get a hold of this?
- With that much carbon monoxide, even The Last Airbender movie will be great!
- Just like the Silverdome
- i read the title as south park and had to do a double take
- I don't think it counts if you're indoors... unless they all have their windows up I suppose
- That's a great idea. In Australia, our NRL (football) season is back in full swing with Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, usually seating 50,000. Social distancing has this down to 6,000. 

They should have done this with our stadiums. Instead, the NRL commission was worried the sport would tank during COVID-19, so they got government-backed funding.
- What's the draw in going to watch a movie in your car? Why would someone want to do that over watching it from their couch- especially if you take away the social component?

I don't get it.
- I haven’t slept and I read “Jurassic Saw, knives out” which I would totally watch
- There will be more knives out in the crowd than the movie.
- Cool, the kids get to wander around and watch people boning in their cars.
- “Jurassic Park” WHOO!

“Knives Out” YEAHH!!

“Hobbes & Shaw” YEA-wait, wut?
- What’s their spaghetti policy?
- There’s a lot of things that bug me about this trend.
- We don’t need entertained we need a vaccine!
- Knives out is free on amazon prime btw.
- That’s bad ass
- Will it draw more people than the Marlins used to?

*cries in Fish fan*
- They have movies outside too being shown.
- Ah, yes. The all-time classic Hobbs & Shaw! Great choice!
- Holy tuna! The fins are running the “super-secret play” finally!
- I don't care what anyone says, Hobbs & Shaw was just fun dumb entertaining action. Granted, the 3rd act did drag a bit but the movie was just fun, Tango and Cash 2.
- Florida is going to become a quarantine state.
- Ah, now I can watch Jason Statham fight trained killers with a toaster with my friends.
- This made we wonder... are convertibles allowed? 

What about windows rolled down, sitting on top of the car, and motorcycles?

And on that note, assuming that the people watching the movies have their windows rolled up, how do they hear the movie??

Too many questions...
- I feel claustrophobic and trapped  looking at this, no thanks.
- They sure are moving around a lot in that 🚗!!
- Why all old movies that are on tv. That sucks...
- Just a matter of time news comes out people dying of carbon monoxide poisoning
- That's awesome. I still have fond memories of seeing Jurassic Park at the Drive-in we used to have.
- I went to a regular theater yesterday and I was the only person at my showing. Didn't even have to wear a mask.
- Drive in/through anything are an awful example of how we are failing as a society. Societies built around private cars are a planning disaster.
- If they don’t have someone in a raptor costume jumping on cars during Jurassic Park...
- Nothing sounds more Florida than an indoor drive in  movie theater
- Having all those cars indoors seems like a terrible idea
- This is great. My family always went to the Drive Inn. My mom would make a huge picnic basket of sandwiches, chips, sweets, maybe a chicken salad with crackers..... old days good times. We loved the drive inn.
- I’m surprised the Holy Grail of Florida films isn’t playing...: Ace Ventura Part 1
- fucking hobbs and shaw
- [Hobbs & Shaw](https://youtu.be/fZbJ8s7taOY)?
- this week a Theater,

next week a Fema Camp
- The older I get the more I think of the exit strategy of mass events like these..imo the time it takes to leave this place at the same time as everyone else makes me want to stay in my home forever :))
- Imagine being in the middle of that and having to drive out after. Sounds like a fun time
- Knives Out was such shite though
- Knives out was such a good movie
- Sorry but knives out would be a terrible drive in movie.

You want loud, action packed, nonsense - where the plot doesn’t matter much.

Not a slow burn, weird, (and not very good) murder-mystery (that didn’t actually make sense).

But forget “knives out,” a drive in theatre should just run, Alien and Die Hard as a double feature forever. I’d go see that a dozen times a year for sure.

Why not? Drive up, pay, eat popcorn, crank my car stereo, “run bitch, ruuuuun.”
- I am loving this trend.

I live in a city that is in an open war against cars. Buses are empty, public transport are losing money because of Covid.  People, who never stopped buying cars or SUVs, are able now to move out to the suburbs because of distance working ; the mayor is using the pandemic as an excuse to remove miles of parking spaces for activity areas.  They are not used. That mayor will lose the next election.
- I just watched knives out yesterday-  it was bad.  I don’t see why so many people praised it.
- Didn't mat pay predict this?
- Its awesome that they are making these drive-ins, real question is how are we going to get the popcorn?
- Our dystopia is weird.
- Err we have seem them so good luck with that
- There’s a drive in not far from me. They were forced to close due to Covid restrictions. I thought that was odd.
- Can anyone with experience in the matter care to explain how they did and do sound now a days to someone who lives in a country where drive-in movies isn't really a thing?
- Could this not be dangerous in terms of all the fumes in a semi-enclosed space? Or will they open up the top? Do people turn their cars off at Drive ins still? Last time I went to one nearly everyone left their car on.
- [removed]
- This sounds like a great idea. Less so with Knives Out. That movie sucked so hard.
- Sooo fucking wasteful of a culture.  Our descendants will ridicule us.
- So everyone is going to get carbon monoxide poisoning because they are INDOORS.
- For 5$ extra, they let you relieve yourself on the 50-yard line.
- If that is the only area that needs to be sanitized often, at least that is do-able.

At regular movie theaters, and restaurants, and etc. nearly everything is communal. There is sooo much sanitizing that needs to be done. Its almost impossible to keep up on while still doing all your other tasks. 

I just hope they stay on top of it, especially with 12% positivity rate in Florida testing.
- Gator aid bottle.
- Idk, a stadium that normally holds tens of thousands of people only containing about 200-500 people. They should have enough bathrooms to make people feel comfortably distanced.
- Pee before?
- Drive-in near me is doing double features.  It's a cute idea they they have some fun themes with (Jurassic Park and The Flintstones, Tommy Boy and Billy Madison), but I'm not interested in public bathrooms, and know I wouldn't be able to make it through two movies.
- Depends...
- If I was rich I would of opened so many drive in raves and movies

Two months ago
- Just shit on the ground next to your car!
- Get a pee container like for road trips etc.
- Just open the door and pop a squat. Or bring piss jugs.
- Piss in a bottle.
- Empty soda bottle.
- At first I was confused because I was thinking wait don’t normal movie theaters all have communal bathrooms too? My brain went, I wonder if in Europe or Asia have single person bathrooms at the movies, but then realized you meant because of corona duh.
- It didn't bother me too much at my local drive-in.  I just wore a mask to go in, and when I saw they had blocked off every other urinal I felt pretty safe.
- You can't in normal theaters either and in normal theaters you can't sneak in a near unlimited amount of food abd snacks. Also a drive in theatre by my house closed either last year or the year before and it showed two films for the price of one and only showed new films. I wish it lasted until coronavirus. All the other driveins I've heard of close enough only show old films.
- There's only 230 cars so there's probably 1 toilet per person in a stadium that big. 

Go to the loo before you go it's only 2 hrs ffs.
- I suck
- Piss bottle
- DIAPERS AND CUPS
- Gatorade bottles, funnels (for the ladies) and ammo cans lined with trash bags. Never have to leave the car.
- Don’t use them. You don’t need to drink 64 oz pop. Or use them and wash up after.
- people can't help but try and make money during this time and risk people's lives. that's all it is.
- no can do.

unlike most of the people in that movie, i have an escape.
- >Jurassic Park is a pretty fantastic Drive-in movie. Especially if you take an explorer.

No love for the Jeep Wrangler? Must go faster.
- another no show
- I saw the original at the drive in as a kid, can confirm.
- Imagine if they make the projection screen large enough such that the size of the car in the movie equals actual size of cars in the lot...woah...that experience must be surreal. Also, have rumble speakers under each car.... And everybody has an open glass of water on the dash...
- Lol if you want to tow it there and back maybe. They weren't nicknamed the Exploder for nothing
- Jurassic Park was my favorite movie as a kid and I had the wonderful privilege to grow up and learn that it was an objectively great movie as an adult.
- The local Vikings stadium has weekly indoor running and roller skating in the winter. There's nominal fee to support the local running club.
- I think he actually paid for the new stadium privately funded, and didn’t use the tax payers money, I could be wrong tho
- ALRIGHTY THEN
- They actually played Super Bowl VII last night. I thought that was neat that they did that.
- Yeeeaah that movie's a bit problematic these days.
- Ace Ventura is a really good film except for a single six minute segment that has aged really poorly.
- Last I saw it’s free with Amazon Prime right now if you care to rewatch.
- Ana de Armas 😍
- just watched tonight.  completely agree.
- One of my favorite movies of the year. I just love every aspect of it.
- It was a good movie but not one that really benefits from the theater experience imo. It’s just as fine at home as it is in the theater
- Not a dull moment
- Hobbs and Shaw was laughably horrible, even for the FandF franchise.
- But as a Drive-In movie? What a snooze fest.
- Watched it this weekend on Prime. Riveted the whole time.
- Yeah, but I never figured on it being the last film I'd see in a theater for nearly a year... or more
- First half hour was painful but necessary to set the scene. In fact Rian Johnson himself alluded to the fact that the start of the film is a bit shit but it was the only way he could get it going. 

Because, boy does it get going.
- Completely overrated. The acting was hammy from everyone, including Daniel Craig's foghorn leghorn impersonation.  The writing was cheesy and as a mystery it was easy enough to solve after the first 5 minutes that were absolutely soaked in foreshadowing.  I really don't see why this movie got the praise it did, im not sure why it got any at all really.
- I just watched it! It was quite good.

Too many shows and movies today want their viewer to feel smart so they make the twist completely guessable once you meet the "true bad guy".

This movie does a great job stringing you along keeping you analyzing everything doubting if the writers will be able to pull off something good and believable.

And they do. It's fun, the characters are well written, the screen chemistry works.

My only issue is that so much of the plot hinges on a particular character trait that *just doesn't exist* in real life: the Pinocchio.
- all it took was the first 10 seconds to know I wasn't going to like the chick who cant act
- Yeah but you can pay 40 bucks each to watch it again. So that's a pretty sweet deal.
- That would be a great drive-in movie!
- Yeah that was the biggest "excited for big dumb action comedy"  to let down horribly ratio I've had in a while. The Meg it was not
- Or Knives Out.
- I was actually pretty hyped for this one because Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2 were top notch in the action department, but I guess that didn't quite translate to big setpiece-driven action as well.

Still entertaining, just not mind-blowing.
- It's the 2nd best F&F so I would totally see it again.

- The double irony is that they shut down the Covid testing early yesterday at Hard Rock to setup the movie theater. 

🤡🤡🤡
- Not true, the hard rock stadium is in Miami-Dade county where most people are wearing masks. The non mask wearer's tend to live north.
- That's a damn lie, I see them everywhere.
- As a grocery store worker in central Florida, about half the people who come in where masks. Anti-mask behavior is more common in Northern Florida. Florida sort of has a north to south culture gradient where the north is more culturally southern and the south is more culturally northern.
- Floridian here. Went to get pick up from a restaurant and the inside was packed. And maybe only a third or less of people had masks.

Edit: To people talking about eating without a mask. I was in the front with lines to order and waiting for a table. This was before people were seated. Maybe 40 to 50 people all in there. No one was eating yet.
- I’m over it dude. Too many people gathering and no one uses masks. Pisses me off.
- I live on Fort Lauderdale beach and on my daily walk, the amount of people slammed packed in bars on A1A with no face masks is worse than it was before Corona. It’s like spring break doubled.
- Broward Co. here, west of 75, and everywhere I go its like 99% masks.  You have the occasional anti masker going in the store with a mask then takes it off, but most of us our masked up.
- Movie theaters as a whole are going to die because the studios saw just how much money they can make cutting out the theaters and consumers saw just how much money they can save cutting out the theaters

- Perhaps they have decided to address global warming with self sacrifice for the greater good. Maybe Frump is actually altruistic and recognized he could save the planet and social security/Medicare and race relations by thinning the herd of elderly and people of color. Trump the magnanimous.
- swap shop has had one for like 50 years
- I can hold my pee for the duration of a movie. But the heat would be a problem. I love the idea of going to a drive-in but when you live someplace very hot, it's just not going to be pleasant for most of the year.
- Tesla has entered the chat
- These were all my concerns, too. It seems like an uncomfortable experience all around.
- Ive been to a few and they all had a buffer parking space so you could keep your windows open no problem
- Spoken like someone who doesn’t understand family or a good corona.
- I enjoyed Hobbs & Shaw. It's just dumb fun.
- The death of the fast and Furious franchise is going to arrive at the hands of the people who can't tell the difference between good stupid and bad stupid.

That movie sucked ass, and it's disappointing to see people defend it as if it was even remotely on the same level as five, six, seven, or even eight.
- They have been showing a library of different movies outside, not just these 3.

Some are even worst dogshit.
- Hobbs & Shaw is the best of the Fast and the Furious movies.  They've been entirely self-aware since the fifth one, but this movie just revels in how fucking stupid it all is . It's wonderful.
- >Knives Out

>Excellent

lol
- 90% of people on reddit that constantly rave about bringing drive-in theaters back have never been to one.

Same for all the Alamo Drafthouse jerking off
- This!^

The windows appear to all be up so I assume the cars are idling. This reminds me of the time I was in a major traffic jam in a parking garage. It was so fucking smelly and gross after 30 minutes. The stadium may have an open roof but that doesn’t really impact vehicle exhaust since it’s heavier than clean air. Look at Mexico City (valley) and their terrible pollution. Or Cali 15 years ago. Pretty soon all the people working in the stadium on movie nights will get mysteriously light head and sick. Plus might eventually get hard to see the movie screen after 50 cars idling in there for 2 hrs.
- It's a stadium with an open roof.
- I mean those people would have driven to a regular theater as well...

- It's a drop in the bucket.

The real fuck the environment was all the NY, NJ people who moved to South Florida.

Because of them, the ecosystem down there has been ruined.
- No one is "indoors". The entire stadium is open air. Indoors means they're inside the stadium itself.
- Big screen.
- A reason to get out of the house is good reason enough for a lot of people. I know how to cook most things I buy in a restaurant, doesn't mean there is no value in going out to restaurant. Should people just watch every movie at home?
- This sounds amazing!
- You mean like 90?
- Don't fuck with another mans vehicle.
- Well, its not indoors
- I agree except Hard Rock is not indoor.
- Why’s that?
- It's probably nowhere near as bad as any other event held at the Hard Rock or in Miami. A couple hundred people doesn't compare to trying to leave that stadium alongside tens of thousands of people.
- I would totally disagree.

I'm not saying it's great, but in the world of movies, it's not in the bad category....
- https://lmgtfy.com/ has a pretty good wealth of info on how that all works.
- >Or will they open up the top? 

There's no top to close at the Hard Rock, not sure why people are so confused about this. The stadium is totally open.
- >* that includes a healthy respect for social distancing!!!

It's a shame this same respect doesn't apply to protesters.
- Its outdoors and you wont get that if the engine doesnt run and you arent like mega enclosed
- No they're outdoors
- It's the Dolphins home stadium...they pay to watch people do that
- Well the price of the drive-in ticket is probably cheaper then parking there for a game.

EDIT: checked it is $37 per car, so yeah. Any game I have gone to I have paid at least $40
- Worth it.
- To be fair, it’s Florida, so nobody will be able to smell the difference...
- Shut up and take my money.
- Is...is that TO springing from his car to go piss on the logo?
- The ole’ Channing Crowder move....classic.
- You can clean it all you want but the virus may hang in the air.
- The problem is that at most movie theaters, you can pretty reliably expect a long line for the bathroom after a movie ends. It’s much harder to social distance in a crowded public bathroom.
- https://www.stadiumpal.com
- When your row gets assigned the nosebleed crapper ...
- There is no way they'd have more than a couple of bathrooms open, or else they'd need to both clean and police a larger area, spending far more to do so.
- But people like to drink alcohol
- Mines doing dark knight and dark knight rises tomorow and monday. Im def going
- We need outdoor piss troughs.
- Depends on what?
- >drive in raves

Is this actually a thing?
- Who are you, JK Rowling?
- Never have I been on a road trip where the schedule was so tight we couldn't stop for a restroom.

- Hey just in case you might not know:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic
- Sounds like you guys need to *focus* more on the movies.
- Weird Flex, but ok.
- Well yeah, a gas powered jeep is better than a tram-ified electric explorer.
- Nobody can Escape the Raptor
- 2004 Jeep Cherokee or gtfo...
- Bingo. I am kind of pissed they have FM transmission now, we had to have that big stupid can hang in through the window. Sound effects and music were still on point.
- I mean, skewed perspective because I was a kid, but when I went to universal studios Hollywood a few summers later, the T-rex robot was about the right size.

This was a walk along attraction, not the ride, that was years later. They actually let visitors operate the Velociraptor hatchling puppet.

Honestly, the water ride was a letdown, that studio tour thing was about as close to actually visiting the park you could get.
- I watched the tape too many times, ruined it for myself.
- That's another good example. That's probably really handy in the winter.
- Three NFL stadiums, hosting five teams, are privately funded.

Gillette Stadium (Patriots)  
> Robert Kraft paid for 100% of the construction costs, a rare instance of an NFL owner privately financing the construction of a stadium.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_Stadium

MetLife Stadium (Jets/Giants)  
>The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company, a joint venture of the Giants and Jets, which privately financed the construction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium

SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers)  
>The stadium is being built privately,[66] but the developer is seeking significant tax breaks from Inglewood.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium

Edit: adding Hard Rock Stadium (Dolphins) to the list (via /u/redsox1804)

>it was the first multipurpose stadium ever built in the United States that was entirely privately financed.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium

~~According to: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-only-three-3-NFL-stadiums-that-were-funded-100-with-public-money the only privately funded stadiums are:~~

And then there's...

>There is only one NFL stadium funded with 100% public money: Raymond James Stadium Tampa Bay.

Edit: Shout out to /u/unclestinky who disputed the LV stadium's claim. Indeed, Wikipedia says that it is a public/private co-funded stadium.

>The financing for the project is expected to come in the form of $750 million in public funding and $1.1 billion from the Raiders.

- He paid for the stadium (edit: renovations) privately, however he gets reimbursed if he brings enough big events to it. My parents were season ticket holders for a few years and my dad has told me about it several times thinking it’s a new story each time.
- Ross paid for the latest renovations himself if I recall.
- Which part? It's been a while. Off hand all I can think of is the weird implied rough sex at the start (which isn't six minutes) or the part where Ace pretends to have a mental disability.
- We just rewatched it yesterday!  It's really incredible how much more you pick up on the second time through, all the subtle little things they stop early which pay off late
- yeah, but it's a good movie choice to tempt people to come to the makeshift drive in. You can bring the lil ones and not have too much to worry about. Other than them being bored.
- That movie reminded me exactly how good Justin Lin is. You REALLY see the difference with him not there.
- Don’t down vote them.

It’s a shit choice for a drive in movie.

It’s like choosing The Favourite or Barry Lyndon - almost - for a ‘good,’ drive in movie.


They isn’t wrong.
- Eh, I went and saw it at a drive in a while ago, it was pretty fun.
- Well, they're providing 1000 free meals to those in need, not sure if daily or just the 1k to, saw it on the news yesterday
- I actually saw it at the drive-in.  It was not.  And I like the F&F franchise.
- What’s your first?
- Date nights are hard to come up with atm
- Our local drive in does double features of new release films (well, when things are normal). It’s $7.50. I go regularly, because I can wear my sweats & take my dog. I’d take a lawn chair & sit outside, but it’s Oklahoma, so it’s usually hot & humid as balls, so the car’s more comfortable. I bring a pillow & lean my seat back. It’s actually a great experience, and you can’t beat that price tag.
- We took our kids through an automatic car wash for entertainment last week. A drive in movie would be awesome.
- For 40 bucks you bet you're ass I would. I am really easily led and bad with money and hobbies though.
- Man I love drive ins. Why do redditors hate leaving the house so much? There's a whole world out there besides the computer!
- Imagine the disaster when one of them catches fire
- Unfortunately I can confirm this.
- Have you been to Hialeah? That shit is Covid19 central. No one there gives a single solitary fuck.
- Our grocery stores have been policing mask wearing pretty hard. 

There was a Journal article out about how Florida was doing very well relative to its population and density in the former peak months for the country mostly because of high participation rates on individual preventative action and local municipal orders, in absence of state intervention.
- >about half the people who come in where masks.

That's crazy honestly. And no one tells them anything? Is there no requirement to wear a mask inside? I've seen very very few people try to walk around a grocery store without a mask in Miami.
- North of Orlando needs to be annexed by Georgia then both states become smarter.
- I just don't see restaurants and masks as going hand in hand with each other. You have to take the mask off to eat and drink. I doubt people are putting the mask on & off after every sip & bite of food.
- > only a third or less of people had masks.

It's hard to eat and wear a mask
- Not saying this isn't correct, but I find it hard to evaluate when people are sitting at tables already. We were just discussing amongst the friend group what was appropriate mask etiquette/safety when social-distance seated at a restaurant.  For us, we have been taking it off after initial ordering and not talking directly at servers when it's off... But not sure if we need to do better/different.
- Broward and Dade are doing better then the rest of the state for sure but we can’t close our boarder from the hillbilly bumpkins choosing not to wear masks up North.
- Anti-maskers are Anti-vaxxer’s change my mind
- Tired of seeing my state do dumb shit.
- Tbh ive been to some and they are all great. Its night time so the airs super nice, you are far enough away from the other cars, bring in all your own snack, you can use your phone if you need, its just great
- Still seems too close. A sneeze can get to you beyond 12 ft in about 30 seconds, that 6’ rule is kind of imperfect.
- True enough, haven't got a clue what you're talking about buddy. Corona beer? OK. Family? I'll get back to you on that one.
- It is, but it’s on HBO now. They ought to show classics like Star Wars, Jaws, etc. That’s an experience I’d pay to see. I’d love to see something like Aliens at the drive in.
- Emphasis on the dumb.  Dialogue was really bad, even for the F&F franchise, most of which I actually enjoy.
- It’s a fucking tragedy of a script. The Rock’s demand for doing this film were “I’m making this film”. He was literally given license to do whatever the fuck he wanted, and it made no sense.
- Couldn't agree more.
- Ah yes, the arbiter of dumb movies. Your grace.
- [deleted]
- Yes excellent.
- Yes, which is not designed to circulate massed vehicular exhausts. It would be entirely possible for this to happen.
- But they turn their car off when in the theater.
- Tailpipe emissions. Florida is hot as fuck and all those cars will be idling to maintain their AC. Roadway tunnels have incredibly large ventilation systems to move all the air that is polluted by tail pipe omissions. This stadium probably does not have the capacity to meet that need.
- Because all those cars will be spewing out exhaust for 3 hours.
- A couple hundred people is WAY different than a couple hundred cars, trucks and SUV's trying to squeeze through what is presumably one of the end zone tunnels to get out of the stadium.
- Even if the stadium is totally open, that doesn't help. Exhaust fumes are heavier than air. The exhaust fumes aren't going to rise up vertically and flow out the top of the stadium like a chimney.
- Maybe we don’t go to a lot of stadiums...but thanks for answering! I appreciate the information.
- A lot of people will probably run their engines for the AC.
- Laces out!
- Yeah you’d think they’d be used to shit on the field by now
- Miami fan here. Might as well use the end zones since they don’t really plan on using them for anything else.
- Lmao fuckin A
- Lmao that’s crazy, it’s 7 bucks a ticket for the drive-in here in San Diego, it never closed during all of this, just rotating older movies and it’s been great.
- I was gonna look into it but that's ridiculous. 
I wonder if the swap shop drive-in is open. 
I've never been to one and I'd be going alone probably.
- That's a ripoff.
- What if a family come in on bicycles or electric scooters?
- Article says, "Tickets for the outdoor theater start at $17 per person, while those inside the stadium start at $39 per vehicle."
- Maybe now what TB is down in TB I won't cry as much when I realize it too expensive to go to a game at Gillette.
- You’re down to an acceptable infection percentage, though. We’re never going to get rid of this virus, and you could always catch it at the grocery store.
- It’s way more realistic to wear a mask for the 3 minutes you use the bathroom (and only come in contact with a handful of people) then to sit in a theater with one for 2 hours.
- Fecal plume
- True, I can only hope they have good ventilation since its a bathroom. But that isn't foolproof
- You’re right we should just give up on anything enjoyable in life. Everyone will die from those bathrooms.
- [deleted]
- It isn’t floating around airborne though. It is primarily picked up from surfaces and people not washing after touching something/being touched by something infected.
- I love how the picture they use on their website is something like a 5k run. Like you're going to use this thing in running shorts and a tank top...
- Well sure but even just one or two of those bathrooms are designed to handle a couple hundred people. 

I'm just saying I think it's actually a pretty good setup that they can use facilities made to service thousands of people to just service a couple of hundred.
- Drink alcohol in a parked car then drive home. This sounds like a great plan.
- Yes google
Insomniacs latest prices... that’s the EDC people and the top tier is $500+ a car that can hold
Five people. It’s a thing.
- No, Amber Heard.
- You've never be en stuck in super thick traffic?

Because that's the only time I've used a gatorade bottle as a portable urinal
- Traffic. Or in my personal family situation we had a older adult with a bladder issue. Even if we stopped they would soon after have to go.
- Oh that’s the angle? 

Fair enough.
- Really takes the edge off it don’t cha think?
- I’m ready to go on the expedition.
- SHO ‘nuff
- He said he has an Escape, not a Flex.
- ^(ford escapes are like ford explorers but a little bit smaller.)
- At least in the US, there is no 2004 Jeep Cherokee. It was replaced by the Liberty in 2002 til 2012, however in non-North American markets the Liberty was called the Cherokee.

There was, however, the Grand Cherokee. In fact, 2004 was the last model year of the WJ Grand Cherokee - the last Grand Cherokee to have front and rear solid axles, which is preferred by many offroad enthusiasts as opposed to the independent front suspension on the preceeding WK Grand Cherokees, and later fully independent suspension.
- They had FM transmission back in those days too. When I went to a drive in as a kid (late 80s/early 90s) the audio was transmitted. I never got to use those old boxes you see in movies.
- Sure is. That said, fuck the stadium still. I don't want to see another pro sports stadium built with public money again. The ROI is a pipe dream.
- According to the r/lasvegas subreddit Raiders stadium is funded by tax dollars. Every post that mentions the stadium turns into a circlejerk about tax dollars to pay for it.
- Still pisses me off my tax dollars went to that.
- Hard Rock Stadium was privately funded too 


What made the construction of the stadium truly unique was that it was the first multipurpose stadium ever built in the United States that was entirely privately financed.

A privately funded $350 million stadium renovation project began in January 2015, right after a Monster Jam event. The project plan allowed the stadium to be used for football games during the 2015 season and was completed for the 2016 football season.[25] Stadium upgrades included video boards in each corner of the stadium, additional suites, and an open-air canopy over the main seating areas.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium
- Raymond James was an amazing investment for the city of Tampa. It was funded my a hotel tax that tourists pay and it has hosted multiple Super Bowls, a college national championship, and the outback bowl every year. It helps that it was built 20 years ago for a couple hundred million dollars instead of the multi billion dollar stadiums these days.
- As a Patriots and Dolphins fan, I don’t know why, but this makes me happy. I knew for a fact Gillette was private because I’ve met Robert Kraft, and all he did was dump his money in to Patriot Place to make even more money, but I didn’t think Hard Rock was fully private.
- The ending where [Einhorn is Finkle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEcXIi6NJ8) happens. Its extremely transphobic and trans-shaming. This scene of course leaves out the Ventura realization scene, which itself is a few minutes. Its actually a lot of the third-act is based on this plot point.
- There a couple scenes in that movie I wouldn't want my kid to watch, but otherwise not terrible.
- Ooc is Barry Lyndon any good? I love Kubrick but it’s one of his that I haven’t been able to muster any enthusiasm for.
- I'm gonna see Barry Lyndon next week, is it good? I'm scared that it'll be boring because of the length.
- Right know I'd watch anything at a drive in because there's no other options.  I'm still getting to get out of my house and see a movie, I don't care if it's a "good drive-in movie" or not.  (Saw Knives Out last week and I'd 100% go see The Favourite.)
- What you on about mate?
- Aww.  Bummer.  Well, I liked the movie anyway.
- Fast Five, although I think H&S is the most fun.
- [deleted]
- I mean Hialeah.... Is Hialeah.
- I live in Hialeah, please take your dumbass comments elsewhere. Even people here are wearing masks. Yesterday I was in a bakery and they were enforcing social distancing and making people wait outside. Fuck outta here.
- You’re right with all do respect to the restaurants and bars.... they are the one that’s spreading this like a wild fire.... in reality it’s the people going cause I wouldn’t be caught dead in a Flanigan’s eating right now...
- Have you been to Miami in June?
- >Its night time so the airs super nice

lol this does not apply to South Florida
- Tonight will be in the 80s and 75% humid. That's not exactly "super nice"
- Yeah I live in Florida, it ain’t happening. Plus, I’m too worried about how close those cars and people are with this airborne virus.
- Is anyone getting covid from a sneeze 12 feet away though?
- Star Wars and Knives Out are on streaming services too
- Star Wars is on Disney+ so they definitely shouldn't show that. Maybe the 2005 Fantastic Four? That isnt streaming anywhere. Or The Room? Tommy Wiseau turned down Netflix's offer to stream it
- A drive in is hardly replicating the cinema experience, so you can save the blockbusters and should be playing more performance driven, meaningful, artful movies.
- Alien is a 40 year old R rated film. I'm sure there are enough people that would go out and see it, 230 cars is not a lot of people. But they're trying to appeal to the largest audience possible. 


This is a business, they have the numbers and can see what sells.
- It fell for basically every trap that the series had managed to avoid by that point.
And yeah, The Rock pushed back to the generic family friendly version of himself and away from the only remotely original character he had for the last 10 years.
- I'm sure there's something that you enjoy and would defend that someone else considers dog shit.
- a murder mystery is when it tells how it happened 30 minutes in
- The motor isn't running when you're at the drive in, you just leave the electrics on for the stereo
- If there is an emergency or something, yeah totally. But otherwise not really. They'll probably have people directing traffic out, and once you get out of the stadium part you've only got to contend with the people who went to watch the movie outside the stadium. And they'll have some lead time to start getting out.

All told it's probably gonna be much easier to get out of the stadium for these movies than for every other Dolphins game/soccer game/concert that's held at Hard Rock.
- I’m ready to go in coach! Just give me a chance!  I know there’s a lot riding on it but it’s all psychological.
- As a dolphins fan, I am, but it doesn’t make it hurt less when reminded.
- We used to be great dammit! Make the Dolphins Great Again!
- *sigh* 

We are
- Tua Tua Tua Tua!
- In sd for school, which drive in is it that you speak of?
- $8 here in Wichita.  Ours had to close during the county stay-at-home order though because the county wouldn't grant them any kind of exception (if the other theaters had to be closed, so did they).

They have been back open for a few weeks now though.  I've gone twice.
- There used to be one in Phoenix that showed double feature in theater films for seven dollars.
- It is, they're playing dated movies but it's better than the 40 bucks a car bullshit.  For those not in South Florida, the swap shop does Nickle ($0.05 for our non American friends) car nights on Tuesday and has a year round drive in.

There's also a guy who goes around in a Golf cart selling snacks at Costco prices.
- That's why I order all my groceries online, they ring, drop the stuff by the door and get out, no contact and i paid the delivery man in the comment section while paying online
- It seems odd that this POV only exists in the US. It seems very fatalistic and Malthusian. I'm not clear how the mass delusion got so widespread so quickly. Scares the shit out of me.
- I think people need to start having an honest discussion that we may not find a cure for years........and Dr. faucci is going to regret making that statement about the NFL.......there's probably meetings going on right now, discussing how to assassinate him
- And people are far more amenable to wear your mask just to run to the bathroom
- How dare you tell me to change my life and daily routines to accommodate the greater good of society!
- You can’t wear a mask for two hours? What is wrong with you people
- Heck!  The only foolproof way to avoid the virus (and, heck, any sickness in general) is to stay home and not be around people.
- I’ve been to enough stadium bathrooms to know that’s not the case.
- Coronavirus is an airborne disease. I would avoid spending time in an enclosed space recently used by people in a state where Coronavirus cases are skyrocketing. I’m not going to kill my parents to see Hobbes & Shaw.
- This isn't the prevailing understanding, anymore.

From [the cdc](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/election-polling-locations.html#:~:text=Transmission%20of%20SARS%2DCoV,contact%20with%20contaminated%20surfaces.)
>Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through contact with contaminated surfaces.
- Complete opposite of what I’ve been hearing lately.  Last I heard, people shouldn’t be worried about sanitizing hard surfaces as much as previously thought.
- That is *literally* the opposite of what health professionals and science tell us.
- You're allowed to have multiple people on the same car. The driver doesn't need to driving in this scenario.
- Dancing in a car while rolling on Molly sounds like something I used to do in the *way* to the party.
- Someone Escort this guy outta here!
- Yeah that's what i meant... Sorry for leaving the word grand out. I was just kinda joking around and I figured that was obvious. My brother had one and we drove all across the states. It was sweet. Anyway thanks?
- huh, interesting. FM would be better, that can thing had no volume control.
- Basketball and hockey arenas get great ROI comparatively. Football and baseball stadiums are just so large and awkward they're nearly impossible to use for other purposes. Don't know much about how Soccer stadiums get used in the US though
- Because Nevada (Vegas) is like last when it comes to education in America and if yo u ever lived in Vegas you'd understand that locals get fuuuuuuucked when it comes to tax spending. The state only cared about pleasing tourists.
- ...and it has a fucking pirate ship.
- I’m sorry, you’re a what?!
- >As a Patriots and Dolphins fan

What now?
- Great story, beautiful cinematography. A little long but if you have a lazy weekend it’s easy to get through! Like a moving painting all the way through.
- If you enjoy aesthetics it’ll be enjoyable; it’s a beautiful film.
- What? For real I just saw it on the news
- And you are definitely entitled to do so!  It's all subjective.
- It's a gift and a curse. Sorry. Happy Father's Day
- I live in Hialeah too. I know Hialeahans going salsa dancing. I know a brewery that stayed open during the initial lock down because they were selling hand sanitizer. Ball and Chain and other clubs tried to open early. Last week I saw the terrace at that bar behind Gus Machado on 49th Street full with no one wearing masks; not even the servers. Anyone who did hair or nails immediately switched to house visits when the quarantine started. There are all kinds of shenanigans going on here.
- You don't want to get eaten alive by mosquitos in your steamroom of a car?
- Or anywhere in FL
- I’ve seen videos demonstrating how far a sneeze can go and in what timeframe. Yes you can get Covid from sneezes in the air, so very likely.
- Of course pretty much anything is streaming now, I was replying in response to a comment on Hobbes and Shaw. At least seeing Star Wars feels like an event. Hobbes and Shaw was just out earlier this year.
- These theaters aren't trying to enrich the cultural fabric of the United States, they are just trying to get people to buy tickets. Families watch blockbusters not meaningful artful movies.
- >Alien is a 40 year old R rated film. I'm sure there are enough people that would go out and see it, 

i've been to a screening of alien in south florida recently. it was packed.
- The kne by me is showing fantasty island and the hunt as a double feature and its selling. I think they can handle alien
- Not exactly
- Not really
- You must not have been to Florida in summer.

You need the AC on.
- *LLLLLIKE A GLOVEEEEE*

-  **Just gotta stay** in a positive frame of mind.
- Sigh... At least you're not a Lions fan. Pathetic underperforming teams..
- Hopefully my boy Tua can help turn y’all around within the next few years. I know he’s had injury issues from extending plays for far too long but the dude’s accuracy is unbelievable
- Redskins fan checking in. Not sure where we stand in the race to the abyss but we're contenders for sure.
- I’m a Jets fan. I feel nothing anymore.
- As a jags fan I'm just happy we have meme QBs to take my mind off of always losing.
- South Bay Drive-In here in Imperial Beach.

- Must be nice being rich.
- If that works for you and/or you are immunocompromised, great. But the average healthy person will not be willing to be that extreme for as long as this could go on barring some big increase in death rate. Life is risk.
- It’s not fatalistic. We operate with moderate risk in our everyday lives. Driving is an added risk, but we do it because it’s a low risk. As long as you’re not reckless, it’s okay to go outside.
- Non American here. Are you being serious that a doctor would be assassinated for speaking.. About a sport... In the land of the free? Please clarify, because with all due respect your leader made your country look like an absolute joke at that recent rally.
- Just because the US gave up, doesn't mean the rest of the world did. Look at how low the infection rate is in the EU. This could have been handled with competent leadership.
- No one thinks a cure is coming next week. Well, other than maybe Trump who's sure that if you fill a UV lightbulb with disenfectant just right....

The only difference is between people who being adults and are taking it seriously vs those who are being children and burying their heads in the sand, pretending it doesn't exist because they want a haircut.
- Lol then you haven't been to MO. My wife went to the store yesterday, we usuay get stuff delivered though, and said like 2/3 of the people there weren't wearing masks.  And that's in a fairly liberal big city.  She said at checkout, people and their rug rats were crowding all around her and hacking and coughing and shit.  Goddamn people are stupid morons.
- Has some added benefits, fragrance wise.

- When studies of the virus began, it wasn’t an airborne virus.  It could spray briefly if exposed in someone’s coughing directly, but it didn’t float around on the air waiting for victims.  They couldn’t even agree how hard or heavy you had to breath or cough to actually eject the virus orally.  The virus then takes weeks to actually show symptoms of at all because some people’s immune systems successfully fought it before it could make them sick.  They push the masks because it’s the easiest way to catch the percentage of people that don’t care who or what they cough on rather than let people handle their own hygiene and prevention methods.  In my town most people don’t wear masks.  I didn’t wear one until forced.  One person in the next town over tested positive, and that was it.  It wasn’t even someone who has regular interactions with the public- it was an overnight worker.  COVID has become a boogeyman to destroy the economy.  If you’re noticing things disappearing from your local grocery store again it isn’t hoarders, it’s shortages now.
- People wash and sanitize now.  Of course the surfaces don’t matter in the present. Nobody knew the virus was even there. If we’d have been sanitizing everything in the beginning without knowing why there probably would have been a huge difference in the outbreak.
- Read that last sentence again.
- Hahaha ❤️🤩

- You're welcome. Happy to help any time my obscure 4x4 knowledge can be useful.
- More and more soccer stadiums are being privately funded, so they’ve got that going for them. Not saying it’s true for every new stadium, but it’s definitely trending that way.
- My family is from Massachusetts, Fans since the Boston Patriots, however, my second cousin was a member of the Dolphins, and was even a member and significant part of the Undefeated team. So I also root for the Dolphins. Is that acceptable?

- Good synopsis
- I was just making a passing joke about the price. 

I'm in the UK. Plus I don't really care.
- Yup - it would be boring if we all liked the same things!
- Im not asking if a sneeze can hut you, im asking if covid itself is being transmitted
- I wouldn’t see Hobbes and Shaw but it surely has its fans that would view that as an event. It’s an action movie so at least it makes more sense for the big screen than the things my local theater is showing (Breakfast Club)
- Families are doing it wrong.

- Disney Annual Passholder
- Thank you for the free parking.
- At least your team didn’t abandon your city to play sixteen away games a year while being the second fiddle to the fucking Rams.
- Didn’t they do really well in the 2019 season? Not a hardcore football fan so I only got news as I watched... The Packers....
- In Gibson City, IL ~ 2hrs S of Chicago there's still a drive-in that's been running for years. They were allowed to open up 4wks ago. Last week had a 90s cover band and the original Jurassic Park. Only have had 1 new release to show.
- theyre rural here in texas for at least a decade, so prob aurora and nape
- Really? Drive-ins were already making a comeback around the nation. I guess I have a knowledge-bias being in the industry, but this was the very first thing that came to my mind for movies.
- Well I mean, would it be the swap shop without a little disease?
- That’s why you quarantine and/or disinfect everything.
- I wipe down all container that i can and leave the rest in a closet for 3 days, better safe than sorry
- I know this might be sarcastic and I'm shooting myself in the foot here, but grocery delivery services aren't *that* expensive and are a very reasonable way for many people to reduce their overall exposure.

Just as an example, Peapod charges between $3-10 dollars depending on the size of the order/time required. Assuming you're buying around $200 in groceries at a time that's a 5% increase in price to prevent contact with other people. If you order in larger amounts then it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of the order.
- ...what ? I pay like 4$ for the packaging in store and 3$ for the tips lol
- I mean, I don’t consider it that extreme. Costco delivers and it only takes like 2 days to get your stuff. You just need to plan ahead. If you would normally go shopping on Friday, then just order your stuff on Tuesday or Wednesday. There’s also pickup options at Walmart and some local stores as well. They put all your groceries together in a locker and you pick it up. All online and it takes one day. Even when the pandemic is over, I actually consider it *more* convenient and *less* extreme
- He always make's us look like a joke.
- So I tried to copy and paste your comment into Google translate....but Google couldn't even translate what you said.
- STL or KC? In my experience KC hasn't been too bad.
- Please watch your language, my mom checks my phone.
- Or someone else’s parents.
- >COVID has become a boogeyman to destroy the economy. 

Literally nobody wants this. You sound a bit confused but I'm glad you're wearing a mask.
- You see the real problem in the movie was the fusion of DNA
- Lol right on man.
- Hmmmm, idk. Nah I’m kidding that’s actually really cool!
- Absolutely I just had to know how that played out
- It can live in the air for hours. If someone has it, it is possible.
- Apparently you didn't finish the movie.
- It wasn’t a murder mystery. It was a thriller dressed up in murder mystery tropes.
- Not really, the Lions only won 3, drew 1 and lost the remaining 12 of their 16 regular season games in 2019. Maybe that's "really well" for the Lions, but I' wouldn't stand in the way of anyone considering that in the category of "Pathetic underperforming teams".

Still, Lions fans are probably still better off than any Cleveland Browns fans remaining. Allow me to introduce you to our lord and savior of Jon Bois [on the matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZndxEvFNk).
- That’s the kind of thing that’s fantastic.
- Thats news to my ears. I welcome it.
- I did this for the first month of our shutdown.

There are some hidden costs that aren’t addressed in your comment (I did upvote because within your situation l, it is good reasoning).

The main one I ran into was with items being available that are the cheaper options I rely on.  Substitutions were usually pricey and not being there made decision making hard.

This fed the second problem as far as price: order minimums to make it cost effective. With holes in my staples, I had to do more orders, and had to buy more than I would to get free shipping or to make fresh worth while.

It felt safer, but it was costing me around 20% more.
- Please tip your delivery person generously.
- It's not just grocery ordering, it's having zero human contact whatsoever for a year or two that's too extreme for most people
- KC has been hit-and-miss from what I've seen.  There are definitely areas (*cough,cough,Northland,cough*) with a lot of people not wearing masks in crowded stores.
- In the president's experience, KC is in Kansas
- KC, it's pretty hit and miss here, I haven't seen anywhere with more than 50-60% of people wearing masks, but then again haven't left the house much personally.  My wife has been out for groceries a few times though and says the same, shops at HyVee in Raytown (which explains a lot probably lol).  We technically live in KCMO, but it's right near Raytown border.
- No, I sound rational, but critical thinking is discouraged in the reddit bubble.
- Someone write him a citation!
- Jesus...
- I get that. Where I live, they’ve opened up the social bubble to 10 people. So you can like pick one or two friends and hang out with them (being careful of course), so long as those friends have been in quarantine the same time as you and haven’t had symptoms or a family member who got it. And if they did, after 14 days, you can see them
- Try to explain who wants the world economy destroyed while sounding rational.
- Politicians love it. The big companies that prop them up are devouring everything they can and there has been not one bit of legislation to stop it. Just take our checks and do as they say.  Saved lives for a future trapped in either poverty or corporate slavery. Small business will be a thing of the past.

==================================================
Post Title: What's a "fun-fact" about a movie that you know is completely false?
Author: imatworksorry
Score: 18317
Content:
My favorite movie is Jurassic Park. There are a few fun-facts that I see or hear sometimes about the movie that I can't really remember right now, but the most common one I see repeated is:

> *Fun Fact: The child actors' reactions when the T. Rex breaks through the Jeep's glass roof in the breakout scene is genuine! The T. Rex was never supposed to break through the glass, so they were actually terrified during that scene!*

[T. Rex breakout.](https://youtu.be/WSM8GcShChk?t=185)

(You can actually find this fun-fact repeated in the YouTube comments too.)

[(Here's a r/MovieDetails post with 19k upvotes that repeat this fake fun-fact.)](https://old.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/c986mj/in_jurassic_park_1993_the_animatronic_trex_was/)

However, this actually is not true. It's not really that close to being true either. I think it also takes a little bit away from the performance of Lex and Tim's actors in the film too, since they did a great job of showing fear throughout that scene, but it's chalked up to being an accident. I believe that this "fun-fact" comes from misinterpretation of a quote from actor Joseph Mazzello who plays Tim, when interviewed by Entertainment Weekly around the time of Jurassic Park's 20 year anniversary in 2013. 

When asked about memorable moments from his experience in working on the movie, Mazzello mentioned a moment during the T. Rex breakout scene:

> *We were in that car, and I think the T. rex was only supposed to go down so far, and the Plexiglas was the only thing between the dinosaur and us. It came down too far one time, and it chipped the Plexiglas and broke a tooth. And if you pause on it, you can actually see in the movie that there’s a shot during that scene where the T. rex was missing a tooth.* 

Even though the beginning of the quote, in my opinion at least, makes it clear that it was still supposed to come down through the glass and simply went down *too far*,(I think what Mazzello actually meant specifically by "too far" is that the T. Rex broke the glass in half which caused the tooth to break). I think the end of the quote makes it clear that the moment wasn't memorable for Mazzello because it broke through the glass. It was memorable because it caused the animatronic T. Rex to lose one of its teeth. 

From that quote, it seems like the child actors playing Tim and Lex were expecting the T. Rex to crash through the Jeep's glass ceiling, but it went too far and broke a tooth, which was interesting/funny/memorable to them.

Now, even though I think that the quote itself disproves this "fun-fact" by itself, I think the two biggest factors are from the final product of the film, and the pre-production of the film itself. 

In the movie, the moments just before the glass ceiling crash and just after the crash make it pretty clear that the T. Rex was fully intended to break through the ceiling and try to eat the kids. 

* @ 3:04 - The framing of the T. Rex in position above the Jeep looking at the kids.
* @ 3:07 - The children pause in the middle of their panic to turn the light off and look up to see the T. Rex about to attack them.
* @ 3:08 - The main shot of the T. Rex breaking through. What could this shot have possibly accomplished if the T. Rex wasn't supposed to break the glass? It's framed in the way where the kids are the primary focus and the T. Rex isn't even in frame until its snout breaks through the glass. 
* @ 3:09 - The shot from beneath is set up from the kid's POV and again, there's no other reason for this shot to exist unless the T. Rex was expected to break through.
* @ 3:10 - 3:15 - Bonus shots of the T. Rex attacking the kids. 

There's about a dozen different shots that show the T. Rex attacking the kids from angles that would only make sense...if it was supposed to break through the glass. 

If you compare this to another popular fun-fact from Django Unchained where Leonardo DiCaprio apparently cut his hand on glass and acted through the scene, it's night and day. The scene that DiCaprio cut his hand in is only in one take. Presumably, after the take was done, DiCaprio's hand was cleaned up and then filming resumed. 

Another similar fun-fact is Viggo Mortenson breaking his toe during a scene where he kicks a Uruk-Hai helmet in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. He kicks the helmet, breaks his toe, and the shot ends. 

These are comparable because these were all apparently accidents that occurred during a larger sequence. If you don't think these are similar, that's fine, because I can't think of many other examples similar to the T. Rex scene I'm talking about at the moment. 

Finally, the biggest reason that this cannot possibly be a true "fun-fact" is that the **storyboards explicitly include the T. Rex breaking through the glass**. 

[Full Storyboards of the Breakout Scene Here](https://www.jurassicworlduniverse.com/jurassic-park/images/storyboards/)

[Two](https://www.jurassicworlduniverse.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jp1storyboard01-trexattack-40.jpg) [Specific](https://www.jurassicworlduniverse.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jp1storyboard01-trexattack-41.jpg) frames in the storyboards regarding the glass ceiling scene. 

And I think this is the most clear evidence that this scene was fully supposed to happen. Why would the scene be in the storyboards, then be framed the same exact way in the actual film, if the ceiling was never supposed to break? 

TL;DR: The T. Rex was always supposed to break through the glass ceiling. Mazzello thought the scene was interesting because it accidentally broke a tooth because its head went down too far. But people think that the scene happened on accident and that the kids were genuinely afraid, and not acting.

--------------------------------------------------
Comments:
- “Fun fact”: In the Harry Potter films, the Weasley twins switched roles without the directors noticing throughout filming.

I went to a panel at Denver Comic Con with the two of them and they confirmed it was fake. Here’s an actual fun fact they told us though: the first day of filming they didn’t know who was gonna be Fred and who was gonna be George and the director thought they were joking when they asked who was who.
- Hopkins doesn't blink at all during The Silence of the Lambs.

He does, over a dozen times. He barely blinks. 

Amazing performance, but people have to stop talking about this blinking stuff and just enjoy his work. 

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/nolnGU3
- Leonardo DiCaprio did not smear his blood all over Kerry Washington in *Django Unchained*

Yes, cutting his hand was not part of the original script. And Dicaprio did act through most of it with a real bloody hand. However, after he was cleaned up, they shot the scene again with fake blood for continuity. This is when they got the shot of Dicaprio rubbing his hand over Washingtons face. Had he done this for real, someone on set wouldve stopped him as this is a huge health and lawsuit risk.

Edit: phrasing
- An oft-told fun fact is that in the movie Mad Max when Max drives through the bikers on the bridge, and that one guy gets hit in the head with a flying motorcycle, he DIED and they kept it in the film because it looked so COOL. That's my friend, stuntman Dale Bensch, and he doesn't remember the bike, but if you watch carefully you'll see he does whack his head hard on the curb. He remembers that bit. Even got a current picture of him standing on the bridge, pointing at the curb he hit. 
All of this indicates that he did not actually die.
- That Stephen King wrote Lawnmower Man. He DID write a short story called Lawnmower Man, but it was about a guy who hired someone to mow his lawn who turned out to be a Pan-esque demon that eats the grass and anything else in its way, including the home owner. The producers of the movie wanted to increase sales so they printed "Stephen King's Lawnmower Man" on the VHS cover. King sued the pants off of them.
- Michael Caine being so terrified he forgot his lines when he saw the Joker at Bruce's fundraiser, and this is the shot they used in the film

This actually did happen, but it was the first dress rehearsal long before actually filming.

EDIT: [source](https://www.liveabout.com/michael-caine-discusses-the-dark-knight-2430503)

>He'll frighten the life out of you. He did me the first time I saw him, because we did a rehearsal on the first day and we hadn't met or anything. He had to come up in an elevator to our home, Batman's home. I'm thinking I'm letting friends in, instead of which he's killed them all and he's coming up in the lift. So on the first rehearsal, I've never seen him. He has like seven dwarfs with him, like Snow White, only it's not like that. When the bloody door opened on that lift, he came tearing out.

>I forgot every line. Terrifying.”

Obviously quite a few things changed between the rehearsal and the final movie. Like Alfred doesn't have any lines, Joker comes up with Wuertz (more foreshadowing) and his henchmen, etc.
- The rumors about Pacino and De Niro hating each other or refusing to shoot together in the same scene in *Heat* are fun to talk about but neither is true. I'm not quite sure why they continue to come up.
- Not a movie, but the “how come he don’t want me, man?” scene from Fresh Prince. 

EVERY TIME that video is reposted, it’s full of comments talking about how Will’s reaction is real and unscripted, because he’s thinking about his father who left him. 

Which sounds neat, except for the fact that Will was always close to his dad in real life. It’s a great scene, but it’s done exactly the way it was written.

EDIT:

It's clear that people never learn. Just to hammer the point home further, let's see some of the claims from replies to me over the past few hours:

* At least three posters claiming the following hug was unscripted
* One poster *still* insisting that the majority of it was ad libbed by Will Smith
* One reply that says they heard a rumor that Will actually wrote the scene
* Several people saying that the tears you hear at the end are from Karyn Parsons, Hillary's actress, but no one seems to have a source

This is the internet, everyone. You can take a minute to google something before posting a "fact" based on something you heard once.
- The one I always heard as a kid was that in the Wizard of Oz there is a scene where you can see one of the actors in the background hanging themselves and I still hear that sometimes repeated to this day, even though its been proven false long ago.
- One I see a lot is the flag in rohan flying off in Lord of the Rings wasn't supposed to happen and it just a very windy day that caused the symbolic act to happen.

It comes from a bit of truth, as do most of the facts here, where it was supposed to fly off but the wind blew it a lot further over the town than intended and it looked a lot better than they'd planned.

- Two that mildly piss me off (it’s just annoying seeing false information pushed) pertain to “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” 

“They used coconuts because they couldn’t afford horses” 

According to Michael Palin, the coconuts gag was the catalyst that lead to the decision to do a King Arthur movie. I think the very first scene that they came up with was the velocity of swallows. I read it in their collective autobiography (great book by the way) 

In another documentary, Eric Idle said that they ended the movie the way they did because *they simply couldn’t think of a better way to end it.* Reddit likes to make it seem like it’s a planned “cop-out” but I’ve only ever read it on here and it seems like it was honestly just a happy accident. People also like to say that they ended it the way they did because they ran out of money. Which is bogus.

Edit:

[I just found a copy of the script which proves the ending was in place! ](https://cinephiliabeyond.org/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-the-peak-of-british-comedy/)
- Fargo was based on a true story. 

The Coen brothers had heard a story about someone who killed his wife and tried to dispose of the body by putting it through a wood chipper, and they designed a crime drama that would eventually lead to someone putting someone else in a wood chipper. Not really a true story.
- The Queen song, "Who Wants to Live Forever," from The Highlander. People will commonly cite it as being written by Freddie Mercury after his HIV diagnosis. However, the song was written six months before his diagnosis, was written by Brian May, and was written specifically for the movie The Highlander.
- >The T. Rex was always supposed to break through the glass ceiling.

Good for her. You go girl!
- A fact regularly stated is that Jeremy Irons blew out his voice after “You won’t get a sniff without me!” in Lion King’s Be Prepared and that Jim Cummings (voice of Ed) sings the rest of the song.

I told this fact to a friend who didn’t believe me and told me to prove it. I found no source to verify the fact, just a lot of trivia sites that also didn’t cite their source.

The only thing I found was [an interview](https://youtu.be/Wmrdn9eFTK8) from Jim Cummings where he says he sang the whole song as Jeremy Irons had sang the song but his smokey-hoarse voice meant it sounded terrible.

My personal guess is Cummings is exaggerating but his voice is used for high notes which are more prevalent post-“Sniff without me.” but there is still some Irons among that.

- The hospital explosion scene in The Dark Knight went exactly how it should have no matter how much Facebook says otherwise

Edit: source https://youtu.be/cxUlkYzHF3I
- That Decaprio did in fact sleep inside a dead horse for The Revenant. No. No he did not, it was a fake horse.
- That Bloodsport is based on a true story. The “Kumite” was completely made up by Frank Dux.
- [Being John Malkovich.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0xvf/i_am_actor_director_john_malkovich_ama/cazwzsm/)

I still can't get over how people actually believed that an extra threw a beer can from a moving car at John Malkovich, hitting him in the head, and the director upgraded that person to speaking role status with a pay bump.

It was a rumor started by Jonz himself, but jesus fucking christ people, it's absolutely ridiculous. If the "felony assault" wasn't obvious enough, how 'bout how the "extra" was captured with clean audio?
- (False) Fun Fact: in Top Gun, Goose actually couldn’t have died that way.

It’s super rare, but very possible for an ejected canopy to remain above the cockpit of a spinning plane like that. The primary aviation consultant (an F-14 pilot) is the one who suggested it become a part of the film - not the filmmakers - because he knew it was possible.
- That you can see the ghost of some kid in *Three Men and A Baby* - there was an urban legend that a kid killed himself in the apartment used in the film, and [his ghost can be seen hiding behind curtains in one scene](http://imgur.com/6VZro7I). What it really is is just a cardboard cutout prop of Ted Danson’s character in a tuxedo and top hat. The apartment in the film wasn’t even a real apartment, it was a set on a soundstage, so no kids ever lived there.
- (False) Fun Fact: Braveheart was filmed in only 21 days.

Edit: STOP GILDING THIS! GIVE FUNHAUS YOUR MONEY YOU LOVELY FUCKS!!

Also, Rorensu best waifu.
- The whole "Harrison Ford was a carpenter working on set when George Lucas had him read for Han Solo."

I even watched an interview where the interviewer brought this up to Harrison Ford before asking a question and this same thing is repeated all the time in Star Wars and movie trivia circles.

It's not true. Especially since Ford had previously worked with Lucas on the movie that Lucas had made right before Star Wars, American Graffiti.
- “All the clocks in Pulp Fiction read 4:20”

They don’t, it’s not even close. I have no idea where this rumor sprang from.
- Not a movie, but a tv show.

For whatever reason The Office fans think every single heartwarming moment was either improv or the actor was not told about it.
- I’m going to read this thread, remember the “facts” but not the context I heard them and assume it’s true again.
- I can't prove it but Im almost certain Sharon Stone knew they were shooting down there
- That Perfect Blue/Requiem for a Dream shot.  The story goes that Aronofsky acquired the remake rights for Perfect Blue specifically to reference the bathtub shot.  Except, people reference and borrow shots all the time without attribution.  Quentin Tarantino has made a career out of it. 

What actually happened, according to Satoshi Kong’s own blog, is that Aronofsky was involved with a planned live action remake of Perfect Blue that never went forward.  It had nothing to do with the bathtub shot, which was just an homage.  Same thing with the references that show up in Black Swan.
- Apparently the oft-repeated bit of trivia that says that Alan Rickman was dropped on the count of one rather than three during his death scene in Die Hard in order to elicit a more genuine reaction of fear, was false and disproven in some AMA a few years back.

EDIT: It may not have been an AMA, it may have been an article reporting on this video, which is an interview with Alan Rickman (date unknown, but uploaded in 2009) about the stunt:

- Ari Aster himself has debunked the fact that an alternate ending to Hereditary exists where Peter gouges out his eyes. One was written way back but never shot.
- Here's the movie fact:
*****
It is actual Muppets canon that Kermit the Frog, in some way, had a role in bringing down the Twin Towers in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.

In "It's a Very Muppets Christmas Movie," a film released in late 2002, Kermit is shown a glimpse of what New York City might look like if he had never been born. Among the scenery of this alternate reality NYC, we find none other than the Twin Towers proudly standing in the background. They were, of course, long destroyed in Kermit's normal reality. And yet, in the world without Kermit, the war on terror is missing its powder keg spark. Who would've thought that green piece of fuck could kermit a terror attack on US soil, but there it stands unimpeachable... We have concrete, canon proof of involvement. Why the world hasn't stopped and asked further questions is only further proof of a media cabal keeping this conversation away from the masses.

The Twin Towers would still be standing if it weren't for Kermit the Frog. Al Qaeda was the puppet this time, and Kermit the hand within.

*****

Now, if we are to believe the crew, this was allegedly just a production oversight, meaning that Kermit is somehow *not* responsible for 9/11. The frog puppet is said to have had no role in the destruction of that beautiful American beacon of freedom, and any links to the contrary are just inconvenient (or should I say convenient) coincidence. The crew alleges that there's no value in searching out ties between Muppet lobbyists and the Saudi regime, so there's no sense in following the money to see underlying truth. There's ostensibly no reason to assume that the towers haven't already been avenged with that famous "we got him" speech given by Obama back in 2012. There's apparently no reason to question the truth any further. [But that's none of my business.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wgx6zPreg4aac/giphy.gif)
- That Indiana Jones shooting the sword man in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was improvised. It was *unscripted*. There's a difference. Gun play is absolutely NEVER improvised on a film set.
- [deleted]
- I HATE that fucking Jurassic Park one. You want a real fun fact? That fucking window breaks 3 fucking times and is some of the worst continuity control I've ever seen in a movie.
- John Wayne's death from cancer was caused by working on the movie The Conqueror, filmed in the Utah desert - downwind from the Nevada Test Site. By one account, out of all 220 cast and crew, 91 had contracted some form of cancer over the following decades (a rate of about 41%). 

This sounds pretty bad... until you realize the general lifetime risk of being diagnosed with a cancer is the exact same number: about 41%.

\*not exactly a "fun fact," but a widely quoted piece of movie trivia that isn't actually true.
- That while filming chappie, ninja and the director hated each other.
- The cast of Alien not knowing what would happen during the chestburster scene and Veronica Cartwright passing out while shooting. They obviously knew. It’s on the shooting script and they would have obviously seen the effects team and the chestburster prop under the table. They just didn’t know how much blood there would be. And Cartwright obviously didn’t pass out either.
- Caddyshack was originally supposed to be about the caddies.
- "Jamie Foxx demanded that the script was rewritten so that his character 'wins' on Law Abiding Citizen"

[He didn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c3okuy/jamie_foxx_didnt_change_the_ending_to_law_abiding/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
- Anyone enjoying this should pop over to r/shittymoviedetails
- Eurotrip. 

 “ here’s a fun fact.. You made out with your sister!”
- Most of the 'facts' where it's something unplanned or random that the actor decided to do and they kept in the film, sounds fake to me. Not that I don't think the actor doesn't do that, but I don't believe it's always that one take that gets in the movie.

A good example of what I mean is one of the bloopers for Parks & Rec where Leslie needs Andy to get something from her office and while she explains what it is he gets distracted and looks off to the ceiling. [That first take where he does it cracks Amy Poehler up and the take is ruined](https://youtu.be/cOYklfjVMPg?t=587). But they include it (from a different take) into the actual episode.

So I believe that a lot of times an actor has a unique idea or an extra line or whatever, but I doubt it's not extremely rare for that first take to be included in the film (in Parks & Rec again: Chriss Pratt actually being naked when Leslie opens the door, or when Viggo Mortensen breaks his toe in The Two Towers would be two exceptions).
- Pretty much half of the lore regarding the Star Wars films.

Vader wasn't always supposed to be Luke's father, Luke and Leia weren't always supposed to be siblings, Lucas didn't ever have the scripts for all 6 films written out ahead of time, Gary Kurtz didn't quit because Lucas was abandoning the "dark ending" he had originally planned for Return of the Jedi, etc, etc.
- Not about a movie, but I remember the rumor going around that Marilyn Manson was actually Paul Pfeiffer [from The Wonder Years](https://i.imgur.com/0DDzn6m.jpg) lol.
- Remember in Aladdin if you put up the volume you can hear someone whisper “all the children take off your clothes”? Was that ever disproven?
- Fun Fact: The sexy girl in Goldfinger died of "skin suffocation" because they painted her gold and made her lay down all day for a dozen takes... but they decided to keep it in the film.
- anytime an actor \*improvises\* a famous line
- It’s less a fun fact and more a persistent line of bullshit:

A movie claiming to be “based on a true story” is completely meaningless.

There are no laws or rules determining the difference between “based on a true story”, “based on actual events”, or “based on an ancient chinese secret”. Legally speaking The Toxic Avenger Part 4: Citizen Toxie could claim to be based on a true story. Unless you’ve read a legitimate article from a legitimate source about the supposed “true story” assume its 90-100% bullshit. Texas Chainsaw was based loosely around the hobbies of serial killer Ed Gein. Last House on the Left was based on The Virgin Spring which was based on folklore. House of 1000 Corpses was based on several Tobe Hooper films. The Ghost and And The Darkness may as well have been fiction it strayed so far from the truth. And every film ever based on the testimony of Ed and Lorraine Warren has only ever been verified by... Ed and Lorraine Warren.
- Not sure if stated, but Tolkien never gave his "blessing" or discussed with Christopher Lee about him playing Gandalf.  They met once briefly in a social setting, exchanged pleasantries but that was it.  Christopher Lee always wanted to play Gandalf, as Lord of the Rings was his favorite book.  Those two facts somehow got combined.
- I know everyone haven’t seen this shit movie *Wrong Turn 6* here, but the trivia on IMDb says that when they go to the market, Zac Efron can be seen in a missing sign. I’ve noticed that part, but this is not even him. It could be a cool fact if it was true, I guess.
- A number of people believe Disney’s Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film with a screenplay. This isn’t true, as Bill Peet did a proper screenplay for Sword in the Stone.
- A lot of people say that Heath Ledger's acting was improvised during the hospital scene in The Dark Knight.
- The hoverboards in Back to the Future II were real but parent advocacy groups forced a ban on their release due to fears children would get hurt.
- [deleted]
- [deleted]
- At the end of Back to the Future Part III, we see Verne, the youngest of the Brown children, grab his crotch and making a "come here" hand motion.

While this is commonly seen as an obscene gesture, I believe I read it was a signal they had given the child as a way to tell them he had to potty without speaking while cameras rolled.
- The Matrix 

False fun fact: that the original idea behind the "humans as energy" was to make it that the machines wanted to use them as CPU processors since it's so unscientific that the human body alone could power the Matrix. Except.....

The truth: from the very first draft, the humans were being used for their body's energy. In an interview the Ws clarified that humans act simply as spark plugs that keep the GIANT FUSION REACTORS going. Everyone conveniently ignores the giant ass towers that are are fusion reactors. This is what powers the Matrix not the humans, human bodys are like a car battery for an engine, they simply kick start the reactors. Morpheus even says "combined with a form of fusion."

It was William Gibson who pointed out how it would make more sense for it to be CPU processors and so it the false fun fact began with him.
- The idea for the rolling boulder trap from the *Raiders of the Lost Ark* came from a giant snowball bit in an Abbott and Costello film, *Hit the Ice*.

An old VHS cover said it, so of course I believed it.
- That Rick Dalton never filmed scenes as Virgil in *The Great Escape* before Steve McQueen.
- People say Heath Ledger was so mentally disturbed after playing the joker that he killed himself. It’s too bad Ledger’s career and life have been tarnished by a rumor that’s so laughably stupid and verifiably wrong.
- That Annie Hall was originally filmed as a murder mystery and the romance subplot was the only thing kept. The murder mystery was in a draft of the script, but never filmed. The first cut was trimmed by about an hour, but it was mostly more of the surreal and non-sequitur material that was cut.
- I'm surprised that Kubrick hasn't made an appearance on this list. My absolute favorite is the one where the Shining is a thinly-veiled confession for faking the moon landing.
- Bond (Timothy dalton) cutting the air hoses with a machete to set a trailer full of liquid cocaine loose downhill. Truck trailers use compressed air to unlock the brakes. So cutting down the hoses would have locked up the brakes not release the brakes.
- That the "how am I funny" scene in goodfellas was improvised.  It was suggested by Joe Pesci based on his experience with some mafia guy when he was younger.
- That the gold-painted lady in Goldfinger really died because of skin asphyxiation. Even after Mythbusters (and numerous other internet sites) debunked this and the fact that Shirley Eaton is very much alive, I still hear that "fact" being thrown around from time to time.
- It was a common belief that in King Kong vs Godzilla there was an alternate ending made specifically for Japan where Godzilla wins. The truth is the movie has just one ending.
- "George Lucas was not the main creative force behind Star Wars." Or many variations of the same thing.
- The Godfather wasn't originally made with the plan to cast Eddie Murphy as all of the characters.
- In “Pulp Fiction” the band aid on the back of Marcellus’s neck is somehow tied to what’s in the briefcase (some say it’s his soul). 

Not true. Tarantino said Ving Rames cut himself shaving his head and left the band aid in scenes on camera just cause he thought it seemed authentic.
- There's that "fun fact" about  the Pilate scene in Life of Brian that the extras were told they'd be fired if they'd laugh "because it was supposed to be a serious scene" (in a fucking Monty Python movie). What else would the point of the scene be? Its clearly established by the main actors in the scene that the lisp and the name is funny. Why would Palin repeat the name so provocatively? Why would they shoot a close up of that one guy twisting his face like that? Why would that other guy just laugh out loud so appropriately timed? Why would Palin and the others stay in character?
- The "I'm walking here" scene from Midnight Cowboy was improvised. It was a scripted line and fully rehearsed.
- "Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason"  

From the movie "Swordfish".  There is no historical record backing up this statement.  Regardless it's sounds bad ass.

*edit - on instead of of lol
- wow i was aware of and believed almost all of these
- That Viggo Mortensen was cast in LOTR because the original actor, Stuart Townsend, was too young. In reality Stuart was fired due to his drinking problems.
- In the movie Teen Wolf, during the celebration at the end of the basketball game an extra in the stands can be seen with his penis out.

(he just has his fly open for some weird reason)
- King Kong wins in every version of King Kong vs. Godzilla. The outcome of the titular match is not different in the Japanese version.

Most Godzilla fans know this nowadays but the rumor is still fairly alive around the internet. I thought it was important to clear this up now that we're getting a rematch next year. I'm a huge fan of the Big G but King Kong defeated him. That's just a fact (Also is not like he killed Godzilla. They both fall into the water and only King Kong comes out victorious. It's most likely Godzilla escaped by swimming underwater)
- Braveheart was filmed in 3 weeks
- [deleted]
- I always like seeing the interview with the reporter where they tell her they weren't actually twins, just met at the tryouts. I could see Fred and George doing this.

https://youtu.be/wZ7vN8LTNrk
- Wow he blinked like 20 times just in that one gif, and that's just when I left the page as I was tired of counting them
- He's chilling for a lot of reasons but the lack of regular blinking is a big one. It's bullshit to say that he doesn't blink but it feels like Hopkins chooses when to do so rather than doing it just as an impulse or instinct, and it seems unnatural as a result. 

I agree that the focus (and myth-building) about one aspect of his performance is ridiculous. But I feel that way about a lot of these "fun facts" that are just... incorrect tidbits of trivia that try to add some kind of mystique to something that isn't really all that mysterious.
- That's also kinda basic acting.  How often do you see any actor blink? Not very often. At least during close ups.
- Thank you! I had thought the same. No WAY that they would have let him smear real blood on Kerry Washington.
- [deleted]
- Plus the shot of him breaking the glass and smearing the blood are different camera angles. Besides action stunts, movie scenes are typically only shot with a single camera. Every different angle you see is a completely different take. If you see the camera angle change in a scene, that new angle may have been shot hours or even days later on set (when compared to the previous angle).
 
What most likely happened is that Leo did the take where he cut his hand, they finished the shot, then paused shooting for the day while Leo got medical attention. Then they got the blood smearing take the next day.
- Taken from IMDB: 
> "When Leonardo DiCaprio's character Calvin Candie smashes his hand on the dinner table, the actor accidentally crushed a small stemmed glass with his palm and really began to bleed. DiCaprio ignored it, stayed in character, and continued with the scene. Tarantino was so impressed that he used this take in the final print, and when he called cut, the room erupted in a standing ovation. DiCaprio's hand was bandaged and he suggested the idea of smearing blood onto the face of Kerry Washington. Tarantino and Washington both liked this, so Tarantino got some fake blood together."
- IIRC, there was a stunt in Mad Max 2 that went wrong and the stunt man was injured very badly but they kept it in the film becuase it looked cool.
- > That's my friend, stuntman Dale Bensch, and he doesn't remember the bike

I bet he doesn’t
- The amount of movies based on Stephen king short stories that bare little or no resemblance to the original are astonishing. His earliest short story book night shift has spawned so many movies it's incredible with apparently more on the way.

Then there are movies that are almost completely faithful to the source materia, that people never associate with king is also remarkable, Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption.
- I just had a thought!

What if the movie was about Stephen King's Lawnmower Man, as in, the dude who mowed Steven King's grass! Then you could legally call it "Stephen King's Lawnmower Man" -- And make the dude do any story you want.
- The original title was supposed to be changed to Cybergod. But for marketing reasons the lawnmower man was kept.
- Or similarly, the fake rumor that the hospital explosion gag was improvised. Nope! Planned! From what I understand they knew for practical and safety reasons there was going to be a delay and seperate explosions so they built that in. That shit gets repeated on reddit LIKE CRAZY tho
- The number of "fun fact" I've heard about TDK just solely based around Heath Ledger's Joker is incredible.
- >When the bloody door opened on that lift

YOU WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO BLOW THE BLOODY DOORS OFF
- [Caine SEECRETS](https://youtu.be/Cw4SBVpZdEQ?t=20)
- I think this is true about a lot of movie trivia. Even if some fun anecdote about filming a scene is true, that doesn't necessarily mean they used that particular take in the final movie.
- They made Righteous Kill together because they wanted to be in a movie together and actually be in it together.
- I think the rumors about them hating each other started because neither is particularly effusive about other people and they've also had a bit of a forced "rivalry" since the 1970s (which is kind of stupid because they're very different actors).
- [Here’s a behind the scenes photo of the two with Michael Mann on set during the diner scene.](https://i.imgur.com/0emRgQU.jpg)
- I hate these types mostly because it really undermines the talent of the actors involved.
- I was hoping someone would mention this! Thank you, I just saw it this week on facebook and cringed when I see the comment, and it's there without fail every time.
- People really think it’s unscripted? Smith did an interview where he speaks about having to rehearse it constantly and Avery pushing him.
- Every kid who ever bought a Fresh Prince record knows that Will and his dad are cool. 

He talks about going to his dad for advice on the first track of Homebase. 

His first Grammy was for a song called "Parents Just Don't Understand," where he steals his parents' car. 

On Code Red, he talks about going home to his family in Philly, and his dad says grace before dinner.

Thank you for coming to my Will Smith Ted Talk.
- There's kind of a racist dogwhistle to that rumor, when you think about it.  I mean, making up a story about a black dude having an absent father?
- There are tons of myths about Wizard of Oz, though sadly the story of Judy being treated horrendously on set are absolutely true.
- IIRC it was said to have been a [depressed actor who played a munchkin.](http://wafflesatnoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/munchin-suicide@2x.jpg)
- Yeah it's a big bird, like an ostrich or an emu or even a stork I've heard, that they had on set to give the forest a feeling of life.
- Ah yes, The Wizard of Oz is prone to many of these, from Miss Gulch saying "damn" to *Dark Side of the Moon* [syncing up almost perfectly with the film.](https://youtu.be/NtExVJlgEC0) 

I... believe the latter because the syncing is widely available on YouTube, and wow. Even someone sober could not deny there is at least some synchronicity between the scenes and the soundtrack. 

(This... possibly true myth is older than YouTube though. In the 1990s, you simply played the CD after the third lion's roar at the beginning when the MGM logo displayed. Most CD players have a repeat function, so you didn't have to press anything else except "Off" when the film was over.)
- Irvine Welsh (author of trainspotting) wrote a comedy play about the night leading up to the dwarf hanging himself.
- Haha I totally forgot about that.  I remember watching the VHS and trying to see it.
- If I'm remembering the commentary correctly, the wind did cause Peter Jackson's glasses to fly off, which gave them the idea for the flag moment. So yes, the extreme wind did create the moment, but it wasn't anything like the legend.
- What I think is cool is that they built the entire site for Rohan on this hill in the middle of this guys farmland/property. None of the structures, roads etc were permanent or even on established areas. I just find it impressive that the location scouts saw this like small mound in a valley and were like “this is it” and they built everything up from there.
- An oompa loompa once tried to test me....I ate his snozzberries with some Gobstoppers and a nice fizzy lifting drink.
- I'd watch the hell outta that
- The last one always bothered me with how prolific it was.

The police showing up and breaking up a sketch was a very common monty python trope. Why would the movie doing the same thing suddenly be about money?
- Well here's a video of John Cleese in an Interview sayng they did it because horses were expensive...

https://youtu.be/q1RSIwexj9g
- The first one is different though. They didnt pick coconuts because they ran out of shooting money. They just realized even before starting the script that horses cost money so they decided to just insert a gag in its place.
- The story behind that is hilarious. A few years later they spoke about it publicly. They wanted to make a "based on a true story" crime movie but didn't really have an actual story, so they figured they'd just make one up.
- [deleted]
- There's a supposedly decent movie called Kumiko the Treasure Hunter about a Japanese office lady who takes Fargo for a true crime story and travels to North Dakota to find the buried money.
- The entire album that features the songs from the film was supposed to be the soundtrack, if I recall correctly. It was a money or legal issue that caused the movie people not to be able to release a soundtrack. The band or the label basically said, "Well we've got a whole album here, it would be dumb not to release it."
- I mean, just listen to the song. It's obviously about MacCloud's wife
- So many Queen songs were written by May that people attribute to Freddie. Its strange.
- Dinosaurs deserve equal pay come on people its 2019
- If you're familiar with Jim Cumming's voice, the switch from Irons to Cummings after that line is hard to miss. (At [this point](https://youtu.be/XkU23m6yX04?t=151) in the song.) Scar sounds like Tigger for the rest of the track.

The "blew out his voice" explanation never made much sense to me, though. That would suggest Irons only did one take of the song and lost his voice on the first take, which seems unlikely.
- I recently stayed at Disney's Art of Animation resort at Disney World (Orlando), and this "Fun Fact" is actually on an official Disney trivia sign along the walkway around Hourglass Lake, between the Little Mermaid hotel buildings and the Lion King hotel buildings. I wager that is where the "fact" came from. Sorry for the Pinterest link, only photo of it I could find.
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/23/52/d12352b22d6c3ca47b8080c9612c46eb.jpg
- Like Singing in the Rain in Clockwork Orange. 

Somehow they were able to put the stationary cameras in the exact spots that caught McDowell’s improvised singing and dancing...  

I believe the kernel of truth that started that was McDowell said the only song he could say the lyrics of the top of his head was Singing in the Rain
- Yeah and people always think that improvised always mean it wasn’t scripted. It could also mean that the actor came up with the idea during or not during the shooting and they found a way to work it into the script.
- Any time I see a fun fact that’s like “They didn’t tell So-and-So actor that they were going to do X... So-and-So actor’s reaction to X was REAL!” I roll my eyes, doubly so if it’s said that they didn’t tell the actor about X as a prank.
- A lot of people confuse improvise with came up with on the set. They usually shoot more than one take of a scene.
- But you CAN see the camera crew in the bus from the unused take of the Joker in the bus with the explosion in the background
- What about Luke and the tauntaun?
- He did really eat raw bison though and his reaction is real. He’s a vegan too apparently so it was even worse for him. He really wanted that Oscar...
- Han did actually put Luke inside a real Tauntaun, though. That's why they don't hurt animals in movies anymore.
- Not only was it a fake horse, but it had a fire place inside and lots of food for Leo to eat while he stayed the night inside of it. I hate these stupid rumors!
- Everything about Frank Dux is made up.
- They should re-release the movie with "based on a false story made up by a bullshitting narcissist - but it's a fun movie, right?" 

People like Dux are fascinating to me because it once was so easy to be full of shit like that before the internet.
- Seanbaby has an article where he goes over it and if the tournament structure as described in his book for kumite actually existed (single elimination and he won 56 fights in a row), it would've had to have something like 7 quintillion competitors.
- This was so disappointing to find out. I loved Bloodsport and thought it was 100% fact for the first half of my life. Crushed when I found out otherwise.
- Wait, you're telling me *Bloodsport* wasn't a documentary? At least tell me *Kickboxer* really happened.
- The real story is they Malk wanted the scene but everyone doubted they could get the can to land right and thought it was a waste of time. They managed to land it on the first take and Malk channeled his surprise into the surprisingly great delivery he has. It was a surprisingly good take and great moment, it was not some asshole extra getting rewarded for attacking the star.
- Who cares about the clean audio, it would've presumably been ADR.

Not saying it was real though.  Too perfect that they were able to frame it just right, can't ever believe that kind of serendipity.
- Especially when the movie has a TRUE and much more interesting fact: The movie was written, sold, and given its title all before John Malkovich ever agreed to be in it
- Actual fun fact: during the sex scene, the curtain is being blown by a fan held by one of my old high school teachers. I think he's credited as an assistant producer.
- True not so fun fact: A stunt pilot died attempting to get the footage for that spin.
- Stunt pilot Art Scholl was killed making that movie. For the movie, the F-14 was in a flat spin (kind of spinning like a frisbee). The plan was for Scholl to fly his stunt plane into a flat spin. They mounted cameras to his stunt plane, a highly modified DHC-1 Super Chipmunk, and he entered the spin. Something went wrong (perhaps the airflow was disturbed by the cameras but we may never know for sure) and he spun all of the way down, crashing into the ocean. If you watch the movie all the way to the final credit, they dedicate the movie to his memory. I saw him perform in air shows many times. He was an incredible pilot.
- Another fun fact (true), the Iranians have the most combat experience in the F-14, after using them to shoot down [at least 160 aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat#Iran) of various types during their war with Iraq and the only two F-14 aces, [Shahram Rostami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahram_Rostami) and [Jalil Zandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalil_Zandi).
- First hint of it being not true is that it's about a ghost.
- *You think* that no kids lived there.
- Man I always heard that one as a kid and never bothered to check it out (Sorry I just wasn't that interested in convincing my parents to rent 3 Men and a Baby to watch it for a ghost). Who in the world would think that's a spooky ghost? It looks like a cardboard cut-out of a kid in a band uniform or something.

- Its just a misconception because Ford was working as a carpenter when he got the role, and had actually stopped acting. But it wasn't on the set.
- He was working as a carpenter but had been brought in to do line readings for people auditioning for the other roles. After seeing him do the readings so often he was given the part. Yes he was an actor prior, but it wasnt paying the bills
- I’m guessing the combination of Weed and someone’s older brother.
- I remember watching an interview with either BJ Novak or Mindy Kaling that the show is super scripted- down to the Um’s and Uh’s and how Jim would look into the camera. Hardly anything on the show was improvised
- Fun fact: Steve Carrell did not know he was leaving the show until that last scene in the airport when they take off the mic and Jenna Fischer tells him that he’s been fired.
- I think people do this because they can't handle the cognitive dissonance of media making them feel something even though they know it "isn't real." So they come up with a way that it can be "real".
- Haha this one is so common in Dunder Mifflin I made a parody of a post one time on the front page about Jim asking Pam out, as though Jenna didn't read the script....

It always undermines the actors and it's not cool cause they are so good.

- FUN FACT john and jenna actually hooked up, had a kid, and got married off screen and thats why their relationship feels so real
- People think it's improv, because it honestly feels like it. However, for a decade now, all the actors in all their interviews have all said that 98% of it all comes from the writing. The jokes and moments all play well off of each other, so well that it's hard to imagine it being written so specifically.


There are many moments that *are* improvised, mostly coming from Jim and Dwight. Also, many of these scenes have had multiple takes because every has been laughing and screwing up the take. So, when you see the scene that makes the cut, you can feel that charged energy, which makes it organic, and then makes all the hopefuls say, "OMG they just improvised that scene!"


Nope, it's mostly all planned. Give credit to the writers *and* actors, everyone is doing their job right when it *doesn't feel scripted*.
- Kevin bringing in his famous chili was supposed to lead to a scene where everyone in the office had a bowl and loved it so much that his status as the *dumb clutz* was upgraded to *popular party animal* cementing his story arc in being a rival suiter for Pam's affections and ultimately winning her over and dumping a bowl of his chili on Jim's head. 

This, however, was changed when he really spilled his chili on the floor like a dumb clutz.

You can still see the desperation in his eyes as he was trying to scoop it back into the pot, hoping he could salvage his "Kevin giving Pam his hot D" story arc. 

It did not.
- Haha fuck I was thinking the same thing. 

I will likely be upvoting your incorrect recountings in future posts for the same reason. 

See you then. How good was that improvised Joker scene?!
- [According to Verhoeven](https://theplaylist.net/paul-verhoeven-talks-elle-robocop-jesus-metaphor-infamous-scene-basic-instinct-interview-20161213/)

"When I was young, a student, in our circle there was a five, six-years-older-woman, who came to parties without underwear, and she would be doing that. My friend, who was more audacious than I, went up to her and said, do you realize we can see your vagina? She said, “Of course, that’s why I’m doing this.” That story I told to Sharon Stone when we had dinner, I said, “This happened to me. It’s true. I didn’t invent it. It is real.” I have described this devilish light in her eyes before. She said, “Yes, let’s do that.” Later, then she was horrified. We sent everyone away. The male actors were all gone. It was me, the AD and the script girl. We shot with no one there. There was video. She could see them, she looked at them. She said great. Later she said, “I did not know he was doing that,” but you cannot do it without her knowing. Then, before shooting, she gave me her panties as a present, but she always forgets that. It is a funny story.

I think it was more that the people around her, managers and agents and all that stuff, when they saw the movie and realized how good she was, she did a fantastic job, and would think, “Well, this could be Golden Globe,” or something like that, but that one shot will present that, they turned to her and said make sure it is taken out."
- The story I heard was that she knew about that shot ahead of time but on the day of the shoot, she got cold feet and asked the director not to shoot it. The director responded by saying that that shot would make her a star. That convinced her to do it.
- She had to know. She'd been in enough movies to know where the camera was, and she damn sure had to notice the lights.  Plus, the fact that she wasn't wearing underwear.  

I've seen her say that she thought the plan was to "allude to me not wearing underwear, without actually showing anything", and that she was upset when she saw the finished cut that she slapped Verhoeven.  Utter nonsense.  Maybe it's true that she slapped him, but it can't be for the reason she said.  

More likely, she agreed to do the scene, they shot it, *then* she had second thoughts.  Perhaps Verhoeven at some point told her he wouldn't use it.
- I've read varying things about whether the 'homage' in Black Swan was all above board, particularly considering he waited until satoshi's death and denies influence, nothing enough to warrant any legal ramifications, just slightly immoral 'referencing' which might not have been approved

- You’ve just validated Reddit’s existence for another day
- I repeated the phrase “Muppet canon” in my head about 43 times....
- Does all this take into account the appearance of Bert on the signs celebrating the destruction of the towers?
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bert-is-evil/
- Ford was sick right? That's why they changed a swordfight to a single gunshot
- Very few scenes that make it into the final cut of the movie were actually improvised on camera. Generally when trivia says a scene was improvised, what really happened was that the actor suggested it to the director before shooting, and the director asked them to try it.
- That story was that Harrison Ford was sick and didn’t want to do the planned fight scene. So, he said “can’t I just shoot him?” That’s kinda improv, but it’s a pretty well known story.
- As a kid I basically constructed an elaborate story in my head to justify how this worked. Basically I understood movies weren't real and they had actors but I didn't really understand the extent of that. 

I heard that Harrison Ford shot the guy because he needed a shit. Now obviously he'd never do something like that but it must have been a real gun otherwise how would the other actor know to fall over and die? So over the course of like a year I figured that the bad guys in the movie were played by dudes on death row so if any accidentally died it'd be a-okay. There was a lot more to it but I can hardly remember now
- I don't know about a fun fact but I always get a kick out of how it says **"deus ex machina"** on the treasure chest with all the money they bring out at the end
- i think the official story is that there is a early version of the script where it ends wit a loss for average joes but the studio rejected it early on for being off tone from the rest of the film. so it was never shot or anything like that, but it was kinda part of the original plan
- Worse than the sudden cliff in the T-Rex's pen?
- You want continuity control?

How about the fact that the raptors were pretty smart killing machines in the first one, but then started wearing clothes, flying in planes and speaking in the third one?
- Didn't John Wayne smoke several packs of cigarettes a day?
- There’s a 41% chance your going to get cancer at one point in your life ? That’s depressing.
- No, the director loves Ninja, it was the audience that hated him.
- [This is a fairly decent breakdown of how much they knew](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/13/making-of-alien-chestburster).

Obviously, having read the script, knowing Hurt had been getting prepped for an effects shot for hours, and then seeing a compressed blood machine under the table would give them *some* idea of what would happen. It's just that in the decades of repeating the story the degree of shock and mystery gets heightened.
- Fun fact: bill Murray and Chevy Chase hated each other at the time and originally had no scenes together until the producers made them shoot one giving us the weird but funny as hell play through scene on Carl Spacklers home.
- That's born from some truth, he was originally offered the role of the villain but said he'd only play the protagonist which Gerard Butler was already cast as so Butler switched roles to accommodate him and the rest is history.
- Thats not surprising people think that. The whole movie Butler is showed as basically unstoppable, even spies will say they won't mess with him. Always smarter than you, always 10 steps ahead of everyone else, then, his plan falls apart because he never thought "What if someone finds my secret entrance?"
- That’s something Steven Segal actually does regularly. Asks for rewrites of scenes because “my character wouldn’t get shot” and ridiculous bullshit like that.
- Man, Law Abiding Citizen only has 26% RT. Reamber loving that movie when I was younger and thinking it was clever. Anyone else like that movie or was I just young and dumb?
- [deleted]
- One fun fact about that movie, actually, is that the entire movie was filmed in Prague or surrounding Czech Republic.  Paris?  Prague.  Rome?  Prague.  Berlin?  Prague.  Bratislava?  Prague.  Prague?  Wait...Prague isn't in this movie.  America?  Yes, even the America scenes were in Prague.  This is all very obvious if you've been to prague, and if you look at the backgrounds.  The Colliseum is clearly cgi'd in.

I am not quite sure if the nude beach scene was filmed in czech republic but I assume it is too.  However, it's an ocean beach, right?  Right?  Wrong, that is *clearly* a fucking lake where the water was edited to look like it reaches into the distance with little boats in the background.  The size of the beach, the closeness of the shore, the vegetation all around...all heavily indicates that it was a landlocked lake, so yeah, that's probably also czech republic.
- You are Americans? I LOVE AMERICA!

MIAMI WISE, NUMBER ONE NEW SHOW!
- That movie is still so damn funny to me.  Mi scuzi!
- I always assumed everyone knew that Luke and Leia weren't written as siblings in the first one. It'd be nuts for George Lucas to have written that definitely-not-sisterly-kiss so many decades before GRRM made incest cool and acceptable.
- Or that Screech (Dustin Diamond) was the younger brother of Mike D (Michael Diamond) from the Beastie Boys
- And that he had ribs removed so he could suck his own dick.
- An actual fun fact about that entire thing was that the actor who played Paul did an interview about that whole situation and said that it's "nice that people think of me as some huge rock star instead of the nerd I played on TV."
- I always thought it was “good teenagers take off their clothes”

Regardless, Disney said the line was “Good kitty...take off and go.”  

[Snopes says false, but has different recordings of it](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/take-off-your-clothes/).  I’d say judge for yourself.  It doesn’t really sound like either what Disney says, or what the rumor says.
- Knowing a little bit about the brain I think it's just your mind trying to find something that's not there. If someone says to you to listen for it, you suddenly hear it.
- Yeah it was, it was Aladdin who said it when he was being confronted by Jasmine’s tiger. What he actually said was “Common good kitty, take off and go”.
- I hate this one so much more than your garden variety movie factoid just because of how dumb you have to be to believe someone died because their skin couldn't breathe.
- Fun fact: they actually believed skin asphyxiation was a thing when making Goldfinger, so they had doctors on-set to monitor her and left a small patch of skin unpainted (Eaton also wasn't completely naked, she was wearing a g-string).
- The Perfect Storm. Based on a true story where everyone on the boat dies... So the only true bit is a boat went out to sea and didn't come back.
- True. Christopher Lee barely remembers his meeting with Tolkien. He stammered a bit meeting him and that's about it.
- There were 6 Wrong Turn movies?!
- I’m more impressed you watched Wrong Turn 6.
but, hey, I just watched Transporter 3 for the fourth time in a month, so...  maybe I should check out Wrong Turn 6...
- This is the one I was going to mention. The thing for me is that there *are* explosions when he presses the button. If there was some sort of technical delay, how would Heath Ledger know that the set was only half exploding?


If you watch the scene again, the acting is amazing, but he is clearly reacting to a cue and not anything that is or isn’t happening. He looks around confused *before* the explosions stop.
- People also think that picture of Heath Ledger skateboarding over Christian Bale on the street is real. It’s clearly fucking not.
- Yep. On the DVD it has a feature about the hospital explosion. They rehearsed it 7+ times before the real thing. Obviously they only had one shot (can only blow up a building once!) so it had to be perfect

They also had cameras on multiple floors of the building to capture the explosion from the inside but they ultimately weren't used. Lots of shots of ceilings falling in and stuff which looks awesome
- Also, Heath Ledger getting so into playing Joker that it caused his death is false, but people love believing it.
- If I recall correctly, this spawned from a BTTF2 behind-the-scenes featurette that Bob Zemeckis had made because he was pissed off that people kept asking him how the hoverboard sequences were done.

EDIT: Yup, the [Honest Trailer](https://youtu.be/7Bn121d5Fk8?t=193) confirms it.
- what's the fun fact and what is false about it?
- I don't think that "spark plugs for a fusion reactor" is any more "scientific" than "human as batteries".
- I heard a bunch of stuff from that movie was actually "borrowed" from the Donald Duck and his nephews comic books.
- Rick FUCKING Dalton.
- That's not a fun fact, it's just a dumb conspiracy theory.
- I love that joke that Kubrick was approached to fake the moon landings, but he was such a perfectionist that he actually shot it on the moon
- And that Eyes Wide Shut was him exposing Freemason secrets and they had him killed as a result.
- I mean, I’m sure most people realize how ridiculous that sounds haha
- But two versions. The English version is totally different from the Japanese one...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_vs._Godzilla
- That just sounds like people getting an actual fact wrong. He was the main creative force, no doubt, but for Empire and ROTJ they had different directors and it's less to his credit that the movies are good.
- And really suffered because of that
- On the other hand... that sounds like a top-tier SNL sketch.
- The version I’d always heard is that they got an extra $100 if they could get through the scene without laughing.
- If I remember the commentary correctly, it was exactly the opposite- the mostly Tunesian extras didn't understand the jokes and so had to be coached as to when to laugh. I remember a BTS photo of Terry Jones rolling around laughing to show them what to do.
- [The way Hoffman tells it,](https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/hey-im-walkin-here-dustin-hoffman-explains-his-famous-midnight-cowboy-ad-lib) it was originally improvised, the director liked it, so they had an extra drive a cab for subsequent takes. I'd call that improvised, even if the actual take used in the movie wasn't the improv.

This is the part of the quote that usually gets left out:

> And we do it, and the first take a cab jumps the light … I wound up saying, ‘I’m walkin’ here!’ But what was going through my head is: ‘Hey, we’re makin’ a movie here! And you just f–ked this shot up.’ But somehow something told me you’d better keep it within the character. **And then Schlesinger jumps out of the van and goes, ‘What happened? What happened? What happened?’ We told him, he says, we have to do it again just like that.** That’s in the movie. It almost hit us, that guy.”


I don't think there's definitive proof that it was scripted, unless someone out there has a copy of the shooting script.
- Dustin Hoffman has been telling this story for decades, and I seriously doubt that he's wrong. The story goes that they had to keep waiting for the light to change to shoot the scene, and in the take in the movie, the light turned green and a cabbie rushed the intersection and nearly ran him over. He almost yelled "Hey, I'm working here!" as in shooting a movie, but stayed in character at the last second, and it became the famous line. Hoffman is infamous for being a very method actor, and getting fully immersed in his characters, so I'm very much inclined to believe that he really did resist breaking character in that take. [If you watch the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA), you can see Hoffman almost mumble "We're making a movie here!" while his cigarette falls out. And it's very telling that he breaks character and speaks in his normal voice and not his character while he's yelling.

If you have a source that demonstrates that the famous line was scripted and rehearsed, we'd all love to see it.
- Thank god, I thought you were gonna say the story about him breaking his foot wasn’t true.
- It's also a woman, not a man. Somewhere someone had found an unmatted print where you can see her whole body. In the theatrical version you only see waist down.
- Thanks for the link that was funny especially when she wants to hook them up with the Olsen twins
- I liked when they disapproved the myth about the surviving twin crying for real when they shot his brother’s death scene. I had seen that reposted so many times and it never rang true, it was satisfying to see them at a fan event to basically say “yeah, no. It was acting”
- Some people say he's still blinking to this very day.
- Elija wood in The Lord of the Rings, trilogy. Dude almost never blinks and after a while it’s kinda weird. But he does occasionally blink.
- Blood is a bio-hazard. This is the whole reason for boxes in ladies washrooms *as well* as garbage, as one is technically a bio-hazard (any blood is, ladies, not making some weird statement here) and if you work somewhere like where I do and they have refused to acknowledge that in all technicality the night cleaners could refuse to empty the bathroom trash as they havent been provided equipment for or been instructed to deal with such a thing.
- Pretty sure if you did that with Daniel Day Lewis he'd find a way to murder you in character even if it had been during My Left Foot.
- It actually was days between shots. They would have used fake blood but leo wanted to keep the authenticity, so he kept recutting his hand every take. Same piece of glass too. They actually had to keep giving him transfusions when they finished shooting. 

Rumor has it the Leo kept that bloody glass after they finished  the movie and he keeps it in a wood box in his bedroom. 
They actually allude to this on the commentary.
- This is true. That was Guy Norris. Broke his femur. It's the stunt where he comes off the bike flipping end to end. Kinda looks like he's on a flying harness. Nope. Broke. He went and was a second unit director, aerial film director, and stunt coordinator for Mad Max: Fury Road. Legend

- Wait do people not associate Stand By Me with King? Hes the king (no pun intended) of coming of age stories.
- King allows new screenwriters to use his short stories for movies at the cost of a dollar. There's rules about it on his website, like you can't use ones which have already been made into huge hits, but for a dollar I've been tempted
- The Green Mile!
- The Mist was actually quite faithful to the short story, except for the ending of course. I think King said that he actually preferred the movie ending, but i could be mistaken on that. I'm not saying anything for certain in this thread, anyway
- Yep. The DVD has a feature that talks about the hospital explosion. Basically they rehearsed it many times because everything had to be perfect. The delayed explosion was intentional and Heath's reaction was planned

They also had multiple cameras inside the building and the view as it explodes is great. Shame they couldn't find a way to work it into the movie. Heath Ledger also stayed in character for the entire 2+ min bus journey (there was a camera there too) but that wasn't included in the movie
- Edit: I was spreading fake facts: [Here’s a piece of the Explosion behind the scenes.](https://vimeo.com/360018274) 

Yep. The delayed explosion was intended, but Joker/Heath was supposed to hop on the bus and pull away. Leaving us with an empty shot of the hospital, half a beat, cue explosion.

Still meant to be gag, but Heath did come up with unscripted reaction.
- like when people used to say the role is what really killed him bc he went soOoOo dark... even tho the movie was long wrapped and he was already filming another movie
- Didn't Michael Caine say that most of the stuff on the internet about Ledger's Joker is bullshit, and that during the filming he acted pretty normal and chill?

- They've been getting compared their entire careers. As far as I know they've always had mutual respect but they're not like buddies or anything. They probably got sick of being asked about each other after a while.

- Will said in an interview that he was always pushed by James Avery (Phil) to reach his full potential while acting in Fresh Prince, and this scene was the result of all of it. At the end, when James is hugging him, he was telling him he was proud of him and that "THAT's fucking acting right there". [Here's the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91693DJcMK0) just in case.
- This happens in a lot of things. So many books ive heard were written "The author took a bunch of acid and drugs, woke up and there was like, a whole book he wrote" Ive even heard this about ALICE IN WONDERLAND! lol

- I think her only friend in the set was, ironically enough, the actress that played the wicked witch.
- That wasn't just Wizard of Oz though. She endured a lot of that abuse from executives we would now call "Harvey Weinsteins," except there was no #MeToo movement back in the 1930s.


This quote of hers is the most telling and haunting:

"It’s amazing how these big men, who had been around so many sophisticated women all their lives, could act like idiots.”
- It was actually a *compressed* actor who played a munchkin
- [deleted]
- What’s weird is I swear on YouTube I’ve seen different versions of this. One was clearly a big bird in the background, like no disputing it, and one was like... something else that did look like a hanging body. They weren’t the same silhouette. The theory being that they edited the bird in future versions to hide the hanged man. I don’t believe it but it’s a fun creepy idea.
- Anyone who has ever dropped acid knows that dark side of the moon syncs with literally everything.
- Dude I'm pretty sure I saw a video of someone syncing it to Paul Blart and it made sense. The mind sees what it wants to see
- I think people don't realise how much of a film is made up on the fly. Generally not the major points of course but so many little things are put in either because they were there to be used or (more often) to solve a problem.

Some nice examples of that from the director of Shazam here actually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzNS4U_aE28
- Actual fun fact that isnt false: 

Rold Dahl would use "snozzberries" as a euphemisim for "penis/balls" in his adult novels.
- I mean, the thing about all these Holy Grail "facts" is, it WAS a low budget movie and they WERE making creative decisions around their budget. The thing is, thats how EVERY movie works. If they could afford 400,000 extras and a cameo from Michael Caine and Queen Elizabeth, they might have done that too. They went with coconuts and a cop out ending because they were funny and affordable. Don't know why people want to mythologize whats essentially just good budget conscious comedy.
- I would guess that a lot of the people repeating that 'fact' haven't seen many sketches and are only familiar with Python from Holy Grail.
- The way he says it, it kinda seems like a mixture of both, like they were already thinking of making a medieval film, but they knew the budget would be too much, then Michael said “what if we used coconuts instead of horses, and we started off the film with a scene where everyone is arguing where the coconuts come from, and never mention it again?” Again, this is just speculation on my part.
- It's the same thing with the prologue to A Serious Man. They wanted to start the film with an old Yiddish folk tale, but they couldn't find a good one that fit, so they wrote their own.
- I figured it was "based on a true story" because there are car salesmen.  There's no required percentage of "truth" in a movie that is "based on a true story" so technically even Jurassic Park is based on a true story: There are paleontologists.
- In the series the "This is a true Story." fades out but in the first two seasons the word true remains for an extra second. In the third season "Story." fades away later.

- What the *hell*, how did I never notice that?
Because that is unmistakably Jim Cummings. I wonder why though?
- It was unscripted, not improvised. McDowell and Kubrick discussed it beforehand. And the only song McDowell could sing off the top of his head was Singing in the Rain. 

I think that they waited to see how it filmed before Kubrick organised to buy the rights to the song for the scene.
- Or, as in the case of some comic actors (Ryan Reynolds & Melissa McCarthy spring to mind), the script might say something along the lines of "witty rejoinder" or "verbal jab". The actors will do several versions then they/the director/the editor will pick one for the final product. The DVD of Bridesmaids for instance has bonus scenes of several of the actors iterating on gags.
- yes, that was in fact a real tauntaun
- Frank Dux could successfully bamboozle people in the pre-internet age. I used to think he was a real badass when I was a kid
- 56 is just an absurd number of fights even disregarding the number of entrants needed. The early days of the UFC was single elimination format and the winner would have to fight "only" three or four times. But even that was quickly scrapped in favor of one fight per event because of how hard it is on the competitors.
- Loosely based on reality. Universal Soldier is, however, 100% a true story.
- [The LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-09-18-me-6135-story.html) states he was flying a 'Pitts Special' bi-plane equipped with cameras, not his own 'Super Chipmunk' stunt plane.
- Iran is also the only nation flying F-14s today.  So don't expect any in the sequel unless it's about a war with Iran.

You guys are all getting the true story twisted. Ford went back to carpentry after having a tough time getting parts. Yes he worked with Lucas before, and no Lucas didn’t want to cast him in Star Wars. He also didn’t want to cast him as Indiana Jones. Lucas was auditioning actors as an ensemble and he had 5 each of Luke and Leia and only 4 of Han. Lucas would dismiss Ford out of hand because he didn’t want any repeat actors from GRAFFITI in Star Wars. The producer hired Ford to build a door at the offices where Lucas was reading actors, Ford was working there when Lucas came in, and asked Ford to read as a stand in with Mark and Carrie. That is 100% true. The myth of the story is that the producer set it up so that Ford would be there when Lucas was on purpose. The fact of the matter was it was a coincidence. Ford was doing a lot of carpentry for that producer at the time. Lucas has perpetuated that part of the story. Both Ford and the Producer contradicted him. https://mashable.com/2017/04/13/han-solo-george-lucas/
- I've read that they always did a few takes where the script was much looser and they were allowed to improv. However, 99% of it never made the cut.

Then theres the fact that it's a comedy. If an improved moment were really clever and funny, I dont think many of the actors would be able to hold in laughter.
- Yeah, I seem to recall Mindy saying that Steve Carrell and Rain Wilson would improv more than anyone else, but even then it wasn't most of the time.
- But wait, he didn't cry in that scene, I did!
- Oh, that’s good. I’m an actor and the theories of “X genuine moment was IMPROVISED because Y!” drive me nuts. But I like this theory.
- It's almost like professional comedy writers...

- Yeah there are certain comedies where actors are encouraged to improvise on set and that stuff occasionally makes it into the movie (you can really feel it in shaggier comedies of the Apatow ilk) but things requiring action and stunts and effects are never improvised.
- >Generally when trivia says a scene was improvised, what really happened was that the actor suggested it to the director before shooting, and the director asked them to try it.

From what I've heard there are also cases where it may have originally been improvised, but that doesn't mean the take that actually made it into the movie was the take where it was improvised.  It could have been that the director liked it and then told them to keep the improvised line.
- It was even rarer in the film era when every inch of cellophane cost money. These days you can roll with digital and just let the actors have fun, but that shit didn't fly when there was film to buy, develop and cut. Everything had to be accounted for.
- Improv is an in the moment action. This was just an idea he threw out prior to shooting.
- Yeah but before that they had to replace his lightweight costume gun with a gun that can shoot blanks, put squibs on the other actor, plan out what everyone's gonna do and say, etc.

Sure it's an "improvised" change to the plan, but in theater and film "improv" means real-time improvisation.
- and Han always shoots first
- I did something similar with *Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* when I was a kid: for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how they'd done the battle scene at the end, so, being the not-brightest kid in the world, I figured it must've been a bunch of death row inmates and suicidal people who were cool with going out that way.
- Wow, I've seen that movie many times and I have never noticed that.
- Idk I watched this video and now I’m convinced that wasn’t an accident. They storyboarded the drop off https://youtu.be/64oc_hIm3xc
- That's one that stuck with me for sure. The second someone points it out, you cant not notice it the next time you watch it.
- Five packs a day, from what I've read.
- The longer you live, the higher the chances, it is a constant roll of the dice, a billion rolls and sometimes you land a natural 1.
- This is correct. The local papers were trying to divide them for who knows why

> Ninja: So just to be super clear, all the rumours about my 'terrible behaviour' on set was written by 1 south african journalist, who has written many tabloid-style diss features on Die Antwoord (over the last 3 years) before his big Chappie feature. i have no idea who this dude is, but he seems to have a lil problem with us. some of his other features were called: 'DIE ANTWOORD -
NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT' and 'DIE ANTWOORD - SOUTH AFRICA'S WORST NIGHTMARE'.
- Best decision ever, Butler's performance is the only memorable thing in the movie.
- He wanted to be caught. Don't get me wrong, I think this whole movie is dumb, but there's a reason he smiles at the end. His whole goal was to push Foxx's character to break the law to stop him. Butler's character won in the end.
- Train is coming very soon


They are building it now
- Where is the beef?!
- this isn't where i parked my car.
- Ow! My robot balls!
- Fuck it. I'm spreading that one
- This rumor is global
- It always sounded like "Good kitty..." to me.
- Perhaps of interest, this was the explanation of the character's death given in the novel. So, of course, it's nonsense.

(The early Bond screenplays must have written themselves.  Once you remove all of Ian Fleming's material that is flat-out insane, unnecessary commentary on cuisine or fashion, or offensively racist and sexist likely even by the standards of the 1960s, what remains is basically enough for a feature-length film.)
- Unfortunately, yes lol. They're also going to reboot in 2020. The first two films are awesome if I can recommend, but the franchise should've just stopped after one sequel.
- That was so weird to me because I remember when that first circulated online as an obvious photoshop joke. Then years down the line to resurface and be taken as an actual thing that happened was surreal.
- another fun fact is the windows on the top 2 floors are CGI because someone stole them the night before filming
- Lol at school I remember one of my friends telling us all he went to sleep with his makeup on and when he woke up and looked in the mirror he died of fright.
- Yep. I remember it from when I was a kid. It was from a special on NBC that aired with their first broadcast showing of BTTF2. I was like 9, so I actually believed it and I was so mad at these "parents groups" whatever those were.

Fun fact: the special was hosted by Leslie Nielsen.

EDIT: Slight correction to myself - I remembered it wrong, it aired right before BTTF2 released in theaters.

- Evidently there was a paratrooper in the movie, and he had to dodge enemies. There was a real paratrooper, but he landed out of sight and that's not as dramatic.
- Yeah, everyone knows fusion uses compression ignition.
- Don't you forget it
- OPEN YOUR EYES SHEEP
- I consider it meta fan fiction.
- Was that supposed to be Freemasons? I thought it was more Illuminati.
- Dominic Monagham said his theory on Wood’s eyes was that he had bad vision as a child, so he kept his eyes as open as possible so he could focus on everything, and now they’re stuck that way.
- So what you're saying is, There Will Be Blood either way?
- I love on the Fury Road behind the scenes he talks about how that stunt got fucked up and ended up with him doing all these flips so he decided that he wanted to try to go for a flip record on the first crash of Maxs car in Fury road as a weird tribute. Legend is right. They made the craziest car chase movie of all time with practically entire practical effects and NO significant injuries!  
Edit: guys, i was.being hyperbolic. yes, i know there's cg in every shot (every shot in every modern movie has been digitally adjusted). But almost every car stunt is real and a ton of the cg is compositing real stunts and erasing safety rigs. Like some dude did fucking jump off the back of the of the tanker with two spears onto a spike car, except they had a rig to stop him inches above the spikes and then it cuts seamlessly to an actual crash of the spike car. That shot alone is one of the best car stunts I've ever seen. The pole cars are real! Which by itself is goddamn insane. Real people swinging on real poles on moving cars who are then transferring to other cars! They did that. Involved dudes having to de rig their safety lines in split seconds. Real bikers jumping over the tanker. The final crash of the truck and the speaker car is a real crash with a couple (frankly super obvious) cg elements.
- Well it’s confusing because the young group of boys in Derry, Maine don’t wind up fighting a ghost or getting attacked by a lamp monster.
- I wanted to link to a youtube video of that extra shot of Joker on the bus with Nolan's commentary laid over it but the youtube video i found also included a weird porn ad. So buy the dvd folks! Nolan special features are some of the best in the biz!
- [Link for the lazy to the Heath Ledger BTS bus scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jeHB_gIFEs). As someone else mentioned - buy a copy of the movie because the special features are amazing!

EDIT: [At 1:46](https://youtu.be/9jeHB_gIFEs?t=106) you can see the shot of the Joker in the bus as the hospital blows up in the background and he never looks back. It's a great shot but didn't make the final cut.
- Considering the thread we're in, would you mind providing a source and/or further detail that supports your statement?
- I don’t even buy that.  If Heath did that it’s BEYOND unprofessional. You literally have one take at arguably the most expensive shot in the movie and without consulting anyone he added a joke into it and hoped everyone would be ok with that? Hard for me to believe.
- Yeah everyone knows it was the Olsen twins that killed him.
- Yea that’s all bullshit. I think [Michael Jai White](https://youtu.be/VDF01bt3ey0) explained it very well. I definitely believed the BS till I saw this.
- People romantize the shit out of method acting, i definitely believe it can take a toll on the actor to take a character (the most recent pennywise actor talked a bit about it) but do we really think the human psyche is so weak that willingly acting out an evil character for an entire movie production would actually drive you insane? There are spys and secret agents who have had to kill people to maintain their cover, now that will fuck you up.

I thinks its kinda like being a BDSM dom, its not gonna kill you, but aftercare is important for coming to terms with the hurtful things you just said and did to another human being (even if it was consensual and safe)
- I'm so sick of this rumor because now its associated with every actor that plays him. So stupid, there has been way worse villains and the actors who played them didnt have this "rumor" about the character killing them or twisting their head or whatever.
- Wasn't he injured or something. Like a back injury I think and he was taking painkillers for the pain and started self medicating. I don't even know the full story but I know it definitely wasn't over the Joker role
- The most notable part of that movie was Rob Dyrdek's role as a skateboarding pimp.
- Carla Gugino though.
- Such a shame. That might've been the first time I legitimately felt disappointment walking out of a theater.
- I’m not the person you replied to but I think Al has said they’re friends. I don’t think they’re super close, however I do think there’s warmer feelings there than just mutual respect.

There are worst people to be compared to but I agree that it could probably get annoying.
- Neither did Sean Connery and Harrison Ford during the blimp scene in Last Crusade, or me during my last Skype interview
- I'm guessing it was probably from him saying somewhere that he thought about his dad leaving him to get into character because, you know, acting. And then some fan took that and played telephone with it.
- Now see? The real story is even better bc it's real and it matters. Black male role models are incredibly important in a white dominated field. Instead of perpetuating the "black dads are bums" stereotype, it shows the strength of black community.
- Right?  Will’s mom and dad were very wealthy. They had a Porsche and often took vacations. But they weren’t very flashy with the school clothes apparently.
- Fun fact: she was on Mr. Rogers Neighborhood to show that she was just an actress and that movie characters are just actors.
- Apparently the Scarecrow was a lifelong friend who was kind during filming. The Tinman was a giant, self-loathing Papist. And the Lion was a dickhead. Same with Gilda the good witch; while the wicked witch was super friendly and helpful.
- I read somewhere she was entirely dependent on nicotine and amphetamines - provided by the studio - as a teenager to cope with the demands of performing.
- Very true. Except it wad the 1930's, so women even voting was still a new concept. Basically to Garland, Mad Men would be a feminist utopia.
- Well that was Buddy Ebsen and the aluminum allergy part was true- he almost died from the reaction. But since he went on to play Jed Clampett in The Beverly Hillbillies, he definitely didn't hang himself.
- That was Buddy Ebsen, who went on to a long and successful career, outlived all the top-billed cast of *The Wizard of Oz*, and had lifelong lung issues from inhaling the aluminum powder used in the Tin Man makeup.
- ScareTheater did a video on this! He thinks that the hanging munchkin was edited into the video and uploaded (by a user named "suicidalmunchkin") and they claimed it was the original film. His reasoning was that it looks like suicidalmunchkin didn't completely edit out the wings from the bird, that it's really strange that literally no one on set noticed a hanging body including the actors that were moving in that direction, and that a different youtuber went and bought an original/older copy of the film and pointed out that the crane was in that scene before the remaster.

- Or... Just hear me out... Or... Paul Blart is more than what meets the eye!
- I'm not sure how to process this. Can you quote something? Was it like *she could see his snozzberries through his jeans*?
- People love accidental greatness so I guess it just happens to be attributed to that.
- I was today years old when I realised the Python's sketches being broken up buly the police is literally a *Cop out*
- Yeah it’s not like they discovered they didn’t have enough budget for horses after writing the script. They probably knew and planned it from the start.
- So what you're saying is true, from a certain point of view.
- I recall an interview at the time, they wanted to display the "True story" banner at the start for dramatic effect, the producers or someone said "You can't do that". The Coen's said "Why not?" When they failed to receive a satisfactory reply, they went with it. This was the beginning of line of deception that continues to this day.
- But they had to use a jigsaw to cut the corpse open because lightsabers don’t actually cut anything, they’re literally just light that stops a meter out.
- I loved the movie as a kid (and still do) but I always suspected there was something fishy about all those records they showed at the end.  If they were legit, why didn't they ever talk about this Frank Dux guy on sports shows? He should have been as famous as Tyson.
- What about Time Cop?
- There’s an F-14 in the trailer for the new one, sooooo....
- it still hurts :(
- Gonna miss that wheezing
- Just remember ska came before reggae.
- I fully expect James to find this thread for “movie details”
- Pat Sharp!
- What’s it like being a fucking hack?
- **IM NOT GAY**
- I can hear the Ska in the background just by reading this.
- Yeah, when the dragon and Dennis Quaid fight the king's army.
- See Gillian Jacobs barely keeping it together during the Dean’s Payday rap in Community. 

Though Community is a show that encouraged improv from the cast. Harmon talked in one of the episode commentaries about how they would often write “Donald says something funny” into the script because he’d often come up with a better line than they did. 

Even then, in a show that encourages improv. The scene we usually see is another take using the improved line.
- You and I, /u/theserpentsmiles, we are merely passing through history. This Reddit post about Kermit the Frog causing 9/11 — this *is* history.
- An actual fun fact is that there was lots of pants shitting on that set because nearly the entire crew got food poisoning!
- I aspire to have an entertaining diarrhea story about myself where the least interesting part is that I had diarrhea. Like, to the point where people forget entirely that I had diarrhea.
- Exactly. It's more akin to Ford and Tommy Lee Jones rehearsing pages of dialogue for a scene in *The Fugitive* and then realizing that the only lines that actually mattered were, "I didn't kill my wife." "I don't care." and bringing that to set.
- Goddamn right he did
- Han is the only one who shot
- To be fair, I would be cool with going out that way.
- What the fuck were you guys on as kids?
- Yeah with the sheer amount of planning with a real set I'm pretty sure it wasn't a mistake.
- [deleted]
- I know nicotine is addictive but...
- Quite a lot of South Africans really strongly dislike Die Antwoord, so I'm not surprised that they'd make up stories about them. Conservative Christian Afrikaners (who make up a decent portion of the white population) hate them because of their lyrics and general demeanour, whilst many people in the "Cape Coloured" community dislike them for appropriating and exaggerating some elements of their culture. They have a pretty solid following here, but there are plenty of people that hate them and would want to turn the public against them.
- It was all good except I honestly thought that Fox's character should have died along with him.
- Scottie doesn’t know!
- Lol, it truly is. I heard this in a small town junior high, middle of nowhere in Europe . And it was pre-internet.
- brb re-watching Fury Road
- I don't think The Body took place in Derry, pretty sure it was one of his Castle Rock stories
- >getting attacked by a lamp monster.

[Hospital Scene Explosion Behind the Scenes](https://vimeo.com/360018274)
- If my vague memory of the extras on the Blu Ray of the dark knight is correct, he did consult with Christopher Nolan before doing so.
- You got ~~killed~~ it, dude
- I thought it was his drug addiction?
- THANK YOU. I’ve seen/read Christian Bale day the same type of thing, that suggesting that the role of the Joker killed Heath is ridiculous. He was not “method” like Jared Leto or Daniel Day Lewis. As Michael Jai White says, he was having a ball on set. Ever since I saw something where Bale said that, it has driven me crazy.
- Excuse me what now?

Edit: holy fuck this is hilarious
- These days most Hollywood movie scenes are filmed without pants, they just add them in later with CGI
- Also god damn did Will Smith need to work on his acting before then. Season 1 is like an extended intro to some kind of over egged concept album.
- Another fun fact: she was on an episode of Sesame Street that was considered too scary for kids. IIRC, this footage is now lost
- My understanding was that the actors who played the lion, tin man, and the scarecrow were longtime stage and screen actors, and that Judy Garland was extremely green in terms of big Hollywood productions (she had only done one film before that but someone please correct me if I am wrong).  Back in those days, Hollywood was much more of a meritocracy than it is now, and they didn’t feel like Judy “earned” such a high profile role in a ground breaking film at the time. Thus they resented her and treated her like utter crap during the entire production. 

The actress who played the Witch was also a veteran actress, but she didn’t hold a grudge like the other actors and was pretty much the only person who was nice to her during filming. Judy and her would go chain smoke out back in-between takes.

- And it's a really small set. In higher definition it's really obvious that there's a painted background less than 10 feet away.
- McElroys, Pink Floyd and Paul Blart... I never knew how badly I needed this. Thank you.
- Where was that legendary thread where OP asked for suggestions for film or tv and everyone was listing films and stuff that the first letter of each word would spell out paul Blart mall cop
- Basically...

From his novel **"My uncle Oswald"** in which 2 people team up to steal sperm from wealthy men to sell to women who want these wealthy genes:

*“How did you manage to roll the old rubbery thing on him?”*

*“There’s only one way when they get violent,” Yasmin said. “I grabbed hold of his snozzberry and hung onto it like grim death and gave it a twist or two to make him hold still.”*

*“Ow.”*

*“Very effective.”*

*"I’ll bet it is.”*
- There's no earthly way of knowing
- The idea that something was planned a certain way, made according to the plan, and turned out well is just not as good of a story, apparently.
- I just discovered Funhaus a little over a month ago and I've binge watched almost all of their playlists. When I saw Bruce was leaving a part of me died.
- Too soon
- PLAY THAT DEEEEMMMMOOOOOOO!

THIS BRUCE IS A HEARTBREAKERRR!
- And that there is no first.
- "We can show that"
- Ah, but did you know that reggae came after ska?
- lol yea i definitely would get these two mixed up as a kid.
- Dean's payday rap is one of my favorite scenes in all of television.
- [deleted]
- Bad dates?
- A fact that is fun for us, not for the people at the time.

Damn, what a shitty time to be on set.
- In a deleted scene, when Sallah was made to bend over by a Nazi officer, John Rhys-Davies apparently shat himself as well because he was suffering from cholera at the time!
- It wasn't a mistake, just not adequately explained in the shots used in the film.
- [deleted]
- That Fiona and me
- \*re-witnessing Fury Road
- It was in Castle Rock and the movie was in Oregon.
- > lamp monster

Here was me thinking that was just a snarky dig at IT's "deadlights".
- That previz shot looks like one of those weird autogenerated youtube kid videos.
- Yeah unscripted doesn't mean improvised. Yet, it seems people confuse the two words often.
- The Olsen Twins were his suppliers.
- Yeah he was skateboarding while on set in costume. Joker doesnt skateboard. He was definitely having fun.

Daniel-Day Lewis aside, the whole "method" actor thing that a lot of Hollywood actors do is just pumped up publicity for the movie. You're telling me Jared Leto really sent used condoms and dead rats to his cast mates? Those are biohazards. He'd be fired immediately and would possibly be blacklisted from working with certain people ever again. But people buy it, and they show up to the movie because they see on the internet that an actor is doing weird shit.

I understand actors trying to stay in character between takes of a scene to maintain their performance. After all, 95% of their time is just waiting around for the crew to set up and eating the food that's lying around. But there is this manufactured mystique around the acting process that is honestly kind of stupid. These people are professionals. It's just another job like any other. They learn their lines and move where people tell them to. It's hard. It takes serious training and practice. But at the end of the day, they're not destroying their's and other's psychological wellbeing for a summer blockbuster.

Robert De Niro worked hundreds of overnight hours as a taxi driver to prepare for Taxi Driver. And when asked if it helped him at all he said no.
- Well yeah, he wasn't an actor.. he was a rapper who went broke from not paying taxes and started hanging around TV people on the suggestion of his girlfriend to try and get an opportunity.

Holy shit did he put the work in though, his acting just gets better and better as the seasons go on and now he's one of the best working actors IMO.
- I think Josh and Chuck (Stuff You Should Know, podcast)  mentioned that in their Sesame Street episode of SYSK. I should go listen again! It was a great one.
- If anyone has the footage of Margaret Hamilton(Wicked Witch of the West, Wizard of Oz) on Sesame Street(Season 7, episode 52) and the 4 episodes of Mr. Rogers, be sure to share with the rest of us. 

!remindme 16 hours
- IIRC, weren’t cigarettes forced on Judy to a large degree? I remember reading that she was “fed” cigarettes constantly to suppress appetite and other things.
- Judy had been in 6 feature films before Oz, but the Lion, Tinman, and Scarecrow did try to upstage her whenever they could.
- She had actually done quite a few films before The Wizard of Oz, but it was her first starring role in such a big budget film.
- Arthur Freed showed his... member...to a 12-year old Shirley Temple in 1940, but she laughed it off. She also experienced sexual abuse at the hands of powerful men.

Hollywood directors and producers could be just as bad as Catholic priests in terms of pedophilia and sex abuse. There is a similar type of covering up and shielding of these men in power.

We know Roman Polanski the most, but plenty of other directors and producers like Louis Mayer, David Selznick and Arthur Freed had credible allegations against them. No one spoke up until far past the statute of limitations though - if at all.
- Except there’s no conclusive proof she ever said that. I think Elia Kazan was said to have told some author about this or something but I can’t remember which book.

Just know that biographers attached ridiculous quotes to her name and I can promise you, about 90% of them floating around, were never said by Marilyn. 

That quote you’re particularly referring to as well is strange as it was not the way she spoke around family/friends. Marilyn was very sweet and quite reserved a lot of the time. I’ve never really read about her talking like this, although she was very sharp and bright. 

Edit: more detail.
- God I love his writing
- We get it and THATS IT.
- Like Ringo in India.
- Smart freaking man.
- i read once that Lucas and Spielberg warned everyone to not eat local food during the shoot but were basically ignored since most of the cast and crew wanted to have fun after shooting all day

imagine how bad the set must have smelled
- Save money on matches I guess. Just use one in the morning and just keep lighting the new one off the old one.
- Do it in my van every Sunday!
- [deleted]
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was kept on a strict diet of cigarettes and coffee (and probably a few other things terrible for your health).
- his short stories are phenomenal.
- And that's it. *sniff*
- Or Humphrey Bogart on The African Queen, when he drank only scotch/bourbon.  

Though in the spirit of this thread, I'm not sure how true this is.
- "I've got a song about an octopus!"
- She tells him she's in church but she doesn't go...
- Amphetamines to keep her working 18 hours, diazepam to knock her out for the other 5.

EDIT:. Spelled drug name completely wrong.
- Right? I read “The Tale of Henry Sugar” when I was maybe ten or eleven and they almost all stuck in my head. The one about the kid who gets strung up with swan wings was absolutely chilling.
- DISNEY PRINCESSES ARE FAT
- If there was a story of Bogart drinking water *anywhere*, I would be much more skeptical of that.
- But she's on her knees and
- The benzodiazepenes (like diazepam/Valium) weren't discovered/synthesized until the mid-1950s. Barbiturates are probably what they gave her then, and what eventually got her :(
- Hello Pussies! Princess Leia is fat!
- SCOTTY DOESN'T KNOW
- Episode 5 of the podcast *You Must Remember This* is about Judy Garland's life, from early childhood, to getting a studio contract at age 13, all the way to her untimely death in 1969. It's been a few years since I've listened to it (it was released in 2014), but I believe Barbituates are indeed talked about in the episode.
- So on one epsidoe of ru pauls drag race they had to put a bunch of ex military gay guys in drag. one of them was a friend of Judy's and was asked by her at dinner once if they knew of any good medications for sleeping as she was having trouble. The poor guy suggested what he was on for sleep, which ended up being what killed her.
